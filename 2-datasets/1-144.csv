Character1,Character2,Narrative
HARRY,HERMIONE,﻿What did you put on me?
HERMIONE,HARRY,﻿A Stinging Jinx.
HARRY,HERMIONE,﻿How long will it last?
HERMIONE,HARRY,﻿Not long.
﻿BELLATRIX,HARRY,﻿Show me.
﻿BELLATRIX,NARCISSA,﻿Get Draco.
﻿LUCIUS,﻿BELLATRIX,﻿Why Draco?
﻿BELLATRIX,LUCIUS,"﻿Just sit back and watch, Lucius.
Hm? Pour yourself another glass of wine."
﻿BELLATRIX,﻿SCABIOR,﻿Where'd you find them?
﻿SCABIOR,﻿BELLATRIX,﻿In the North Forest.
﻿BELLATRIX,﻿SCABIOR,"﻿Lovely scarf, Scabior. Though I'm not sure it's your color."
﻿SCABIOR,﻿BELLATRIX,﻿It's not mine.
﻿BELLATRIX,﻿SCABIOR,﻿You don't say.
﻿BELLATRIX,﻿SCABIOR,"﻿Fancy her, do you, Scabior? Can't say I blame you. Maybe we'll work out a little reward for you, hm? That is, assuming all is as it appears. Ah, Draco. Come here, darling."
﻿BELLATRIX,DRACO,"﻿My friends here say they've got Harry Potter. Seeing as he's an old school chum of yours, I thought you could confirm the fact for us."
﻿BELLATRIX,DRACO,﻿Well...?
DRACO,﻿BELLATRIX,﻿I can't... I can't be sure.
﻿LUCIUS,DRACO,"﻿Look close, Draco. If we're the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiven. Do you understand?"
﻿SCABIOR,LUCIUS,"﻿Now, we won't be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr.Malfoy?"
﻿BELLATRIX,﻿SCABIOR,﻿Of course not. Narcissa. Tend to your husband.
﻿BELLATRIX,DRACO,"﻿Don't be shy, sweetheart. Get up nice and close."
DRACO,﻿BELLATRIX,﻿What's wrong with his face?
﻿BELLATRIX,﻿SCABIOR,"﻿What is wrong with his face, Scabior?"
﻿SCABIOR,﻿BELLATRIX,﻿He came to us that way. I reckon he picked it up in the forest.
﻿BELLATRIX,﻿SCABIOR,﻿Or ran into a Stinging Jinx.
﻿BELLATRIX,HERMIONE,"﻿Was it you, dearie? Give me her wand. We'll see what the last spell was. ﻿What is that?"
﻿BELLATRIX,﻿SNATCHER,﻿Where did you get that!
﻿SNATCHER,﻿BELLATRIX,﻿It was in her bag when we searched her. Reckon it's mine now.
﻿SCABIOR,﻿BELLATRIX,"﻿Are you mad! ﻿How dare you! Release me, woman!"
﻿BELLATRIX,﻿SCABIOR,﻿Go. Go!
﻿BELLATRIX,﻿WORMTAIL,﻿Wormtail. Put these two in the cellar. I want to have a little conversation with this one. Girl to girl.
RON,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿Harry! What're we going to do? We can't just leave Hermione alone with her!
LUNA,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿Ron? Harry...?
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿Luna...?
﻿BELLATRIX,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿This sword is meant to be in my vault at Gringotts. How did you get it?
HERMIONE,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿I don't know what you're talking about.
﻿BELLATRIX,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿Liar. What else did you take?
LUNA,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿You look strange, Harry. Mr. Ollivander, look who's here. It's Harry Potter."
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿Hello, sir."
﻿BELLATRIX,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿I'm going to ask you once again: what else did you and your friends take from my vault!
HERMIONE,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿I told you. I don't know what you're talking
RON,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿We have to do something, Harry!"
﻿OLLIVANDER,RON,﻿There's no way out. We've tried everything.
LUNA,HARRY,"﻿You're bleeding, Harry."
LUNA,HARRY,﻿That's a curious thing to hide in your sock.
LUNA,HARRY,"﻿You were hiding it, weren't you?"
RON,﻿WORMTAIL,﻿Let her go! Let her go!
﻿WORMTAIL,RON,﻿Shut it! You. Goblin. Come with me.
HARRY,﻿DOBBY,﻿Dobby. What're you doing here?
﻿DOBBY,HARRY,"﻿Dobby has come to rescue Harry Potter, of course."
HARRY,﻿DOBBY,﻿Do you mean to say you can Apparate in and out of here? And take us with you?
﻿DOBBY,HARRY,﻿Of course. I'm an elf.
HARRY,﻿DOBBY,﻿Works for me.
HARRY,﻿DOBBY,"﻿Right. Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander to"
RON,HARRY,﻿Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth. ﻿Trust me.
HARRY,LUNA,﻿You'll see to Mr. Ollivander?
LUNA,HARRY,﻿Of course.
LUNA,﻿DOBBY,"﻿Whenever you're ready, sir."
﻿DOBBY,LUNA,﻿Like her very much.
﻿DOBBY,RON,﻿Meet me at the top of the stairs in ten seconds.
﻿DOBBY,HARRY,﻿Who gets his wand?
﻿BELLATRIX,GRIPHOOK,﻿Well?
GRIPHOOK,﻿BELLATRIX,"﻿I left Gringotts employ many weeks ago, but when I was last in your vault, the sword was there."
﻿BELLATRIX,GRIPHOOK,﻿Perhaps it just walked out on its own then.
GRIPHOOK,﻿BELLATRIX,"﻿There is no place safer than Gringotts, Madam LeStrange."
﻿BELLATRIX,GRIPHOOK,﻿Liar! You can't deceive me!
﻿BELLATRIX,GOBLIN,"﻿Consider yourself lucky, Goblin. The same won't be said for this one."
RON,﻿BELLATRIX,﻿Like hell! ﻿Expelliarmus!
HARRY,LUCIUS,﻿Stupefy!
﻿BELLATRIX,HARRY,﻿Stop or she dies!
﻿BELLATRIX,RON,﻿Drop your wands. ﻿I said drop them!
RON,﻿BELLATRIX,﻿All right!
﻿BELLATRIX,DRACO,"﻿Pick them up, Draco. Now! Well, well, look what we have here. Harry Potter. All bright, shiny and new again. Just in time for the Dark Lord.﻿﻿Call him, Draco."
HARRY,LUCIUS,﻿Stupefy!
﻿BELLATRIX,HARRY,﻿You dirty little monkey! You could have killed me!
﻿DOBBY,﻿BELLATRIX,"﻿Dobby meant only to maim or seriously injure, not kill."
﻿BELLATRIX,NARCISSA,"﻿For God's sake, Cissy, you've got a wand! Use it!"
﻿BELLATRIX,LUNA,﻿How dare you take a witch's wand. How dare you defy your masters.
﻿DOBBY,LUNA,"﻿Dobby has no master! Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!"
HARRY,﻿DOBBY,﻿Give the Dark Lord our regards.
HARRY,HERMIONE,"﻿It's all right, Hermione. You're safe. We're all safe."
HARRY,LUNA,﻿Dobby... no...
HARRY,LUNA,"﻿It's okay... Here... Just hold on, Dobby... I'll fix you -- Hermione -- your bag -- you must have something -- Essence of Dittany -- something... Hermione! Help me!"
﻿DOBBY,LUNA,﻿Such a beautiful night... to be with friends. Dobby is happy... to be with his friend... Harry Potter...
﻿BILL,LUNA,﻿Fleur's seeing to Ollivander. Anyone else need tending
LUNA,LUNA,﻿We should close his eyes. Don't you think?
LUNA,LUNA,"﻿There. Now he could be sleeping. She turns then, looks at Harry."
LUNA,LUNA,﻿Harry. It's all right. That it hurts. That's what reminds us how lucky we are to be alive.
HARRY,LUNA,﻿I want to bury him properly. Without magic.
LUNA,LUNA,﻿It's beautiful here.
﻿BILL,LUNA,"﻿It was our Aunt's. We used to come here as kids. The Order uses it now as a safe house -- what's left of us, at least."
LUNA,LUNA,﻿Muggles think these keep evil away. But they're wrong...
HARRY,LUNA,﻿I need to talk to the goblin.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿How are you?
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,﻿Alive.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿You probably don't remember --
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,"﻿that I showed you to your vault the first time you visited Gringotts? Even amongst goblins, you are famous, Harry Potter.﻿You buried the elf. I saw you."
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿Yes.
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,﻿And brought me here.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿You are a very unusual wizard.
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,﻿Why did you leave Gringotts?
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿Soon the Death Eaters will control it. That was unacceptable to me.
RON,GRIPHOOK,﻿Then you're on our side.
GRIPHOOK,RON,﻿This is a wizard's war. I take no side.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"﻿I need to get inside Gringotts, into one of the vaults."
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,﻿It is impossible.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"﻿Alone, yes. With you, no."
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,﻿How did you come by this sword?
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿It's complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault at Gringotts?
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,﻿It's complicated.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need. We didn't steal it.
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,"﻿There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault identical to this one, but it is a fake. It was placed there this past summer."
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿And she never suspected?
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,﻿The replica is very convincing. Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.
RON,GRIPHOOK,﻿Who put it there? The fake.
GRIPHOOK,RON,"﻿It was not my place to ask, nor did I desire to. There are more than a few curious things in the vaults at Gringotts."
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,﻿Perhaps.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿I have gold. Lots of it.
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,﻿I have no interest in gold.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿Then what?
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,﻿That is my price.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿All right.
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,"﻿I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the Sword of Gryffindor if I help you?"
HERMIONE,HARRY,"﻿Harry, are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?"
HARRY,HERMIONE,"﻿She was terrified when she thought we'd been in there. She kept asking you what else we'd taken. I'd bet anything there's a Horcrux there. If we find it, we can kill it. And if we kill it, we're one step closer to killing him."
RON,HARRY,﻿And if we find one? How're we supposed to destroy it if we've given Griphook the sword?
HARRY,RON,﻿I'm still working on that part.
﻿FLEUR,HARRY,﻿He's too weak.
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,﻿Forgive me if I don't get up.
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions."
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,"﻿Anything, m'boy, anything."
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿Can you identify these, sir?"
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,﻿Walnut and dragon heartstring. Twelve and three quarter inches. Unyielding. This belongs to Bellatrix Lestrange.
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿And this?
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,﻿Hawthorn. Unicorn hair. Ten inches. Reasonably pliant. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿Was? Isn't it still?
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,﻿Perhaps not -- if you won it from him. I sense its allegiance has changed.
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿You talk about wands like they've got feelings. Can think.
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,"﻿The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore."
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿What do you know about the Deathly Hallows, sir?"
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,"﻿There are rumored to be three: The Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak. It is said that to possess them all is to make oneself the Master of Death. But few truly believe such objects exist "
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿But you, sir? Do you believe they exist?"
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,﻿I see no reason to put stock in an old wives tale
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿You're lying. You know one exists and you told him about it. You told him about the Elder Wand and where to go looking for it.
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,"﻿He tortured me! Besides, I conveyed only rumors. There's no guarantee he will find it --"
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿He has found it, sir."
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,"﻿That's all, sir. We'll leave you to get some rest now."
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿He's after you, Mr. Potter. If it's true, what you say, that he has the Elder Wand, I'm afraid you really don't stand a chance."
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,"﻿Then I guess I'll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir."
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿Then I guess I'll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir."
RON,HARRY,﻿You're sure it's hers?
HERMIONE,RON,﻿Positive.
HARRY,HERMIONE,﻿I reckon you should take this then.
HERMIONE,HARRY,﻿Can't I use the other?
RON,HERMIONE,﻿You heard Ollivander. It's Harry's now.
HERMIONE,RON,﻿But I hate that thing -- that's the wand that killed Sirius! How can I hold it and not feel...
HARRY,HERMIONE,"﻿If I can hold it, you can."
RON,HARRY,"﻿How will we know what it is when we get in there? After all, a Horcrux can be anything."
HARRY,RON,﻿I'll know. I can't explain. It's like...they sing to me.
RON,HARRY,﻿That's a bit scary.
HERMIONE,HARRY,"﻿It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why --"
HARRY,HERMIONE,﻿No. I just know. When one's near.
﻿FLEUR,HERMIONE,"﻿This is the closest I could find to what you described, Hermione."
HERMIONE,﻿FLEUR,"﻿It's perfect. Thank you, Fleur."
﻿BILL,HARRY,"﻿You're leaving, aren't you."
HARRY,﻿BILL,﻿In the morning.
﻿BILL,HARRY,﻿And Griphook?
HARRY,﻿BILL,﻿He'll be leaving too.
﻿BILL,HARRY,"﻿Listen, I don't know what you're up to, but I know goblins. If you've struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, you must be exceptionally careful to live up to it. If you don't... he won't be forgiving."
HARRY,LUNA,"Here Lies Dobby, A Free Elf."
LUNA,HARRY,The sky has lost a star.Luna's image skitters across the mirror's surface 
HARRY,LUNA,"looks up, finds her standing there clutching a small TRAVELING BAG, staring at Dobby's stone."
LUNA,HARRY,"My father used to say that when a child died.She looks up, smiles."
LUNA,HARRY,Funny how Mr. Dobby knew exactly where to find us.
HARRY,LUNA,"Yeah.	Funny. Listen, Luna, about your father, I don't want you to think I --."
LUNA,HARRY,"I know you understand why my father did what he did, Harry. That's why we don't need to talk about it."
HARRY,LUNA,"Hogwarts? It's not the place you left, you know.	It's not the same."
LUNA,HARRY,"Neither am I.She gives a little wave, still bearing the trace of a smile, then DISAPPARATES and is gone"
RON,HARRY,"Always good value.	I'll miss her, What d’you think?"
HARRY,RON,Wouldn't know you if I didn't know you.
RON,HARRY,Ron studies the mirror as Harry turns it over in his palm. You want to tell me what that is?
HARRY,RON,"Sirius gave it to me.	He had a matching piece.	He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it."
RON,HARRY,You mean he could see you?
HARRY,RON,"Something like that.	I don't know.	He died before I ever got to use it.	The thing is…"
RON,HARRY,Go on.
HARRY,RON,"You'll think I'm mental, but more than once, when I've looked into it -- I think I've seen Dumbledore."
RON,﻿BELLATRIX,Bloody hell... that's a sight.
﻿BELLATRIX,RON,"Well, how do I look?"
RON,﻿BELLATRIX,Hideous.
﻿BELLATRIX,RON,"Oh dear, I missed a spot, didn't I?	Hold still...Hermione, poises her wand tip over the bit of ginger pushing through the brown of Ron's hair"
RON,﻿BELLATRIX,"Couldn't do anything about that bit in the back that's always flipping up, could you?	Dead annoying --"
RON,﻿BELLATRIX,"Never mind.	I'm good, That is you in there, isn't it?"
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"Eyes up, who is studying the sword"
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"You can give that to Hermione to hold, all right, Griphook"
WARLOCK,﻿BELLATRIX,Madam Lestrange
﻿BELLATRIX,WARLOCK,Good morning.
GRIPHOOK,RON,"Good morning?	Good morning? You're Bellatrix Lestrange, not some dewy-eyed schoolgirl"
RON,GRIPHOOK,"Hey.	Easy."
GRIPHOOK,HERMIONE,"She gives us away and we might as well use that sword to slit our own throats.	Understand"
HERMIONE,HARRY,"He's right.	I was being stupid."
HARRY,HERMIONE,"C'mon.	Let's do it."
AGED GOBLIN,﻿BELLATRIX,Identification.
﻿BELLATRIX,AGED GOBLIN,I hardly think that will be necessary
AGED GOBLIN,﻿BELLATRIX,"Madam Lestrange!	Dear me!	How may I help you today"
HERMIONE,AGED GOBLIN,I wish to enter my vault.
AGED GOBLIN,HERMIONE,"I see.	Very well.	Excuse me, won't you?"
﻿BELLATRIX,TALL GOBLIN,I don't like to be kept waiting.
TALL GOBLIN,HERMIONE,"Next.Ron turns, sees the Tall Goblin eyeing him."
﻿BELLATRIX,TALL GOBLIN,"He's with me, (with utter disdain)As difficult as that may be to imagine."
GRIPHOOK,RON,They know!
RON,GRIPHOOK,What do you mean?
GRIPHOOK,BOGROD,They know she's an imposter! They've been warned
BOGROD,﻿BELLATRIX,"Madam Lestrange.	Would you mind presenting your wand?"
﻿BELLATRIX,RON,And why should I do that?
RON,HARRY,"Harry, what do we do?	Harry...?"
BOGROD,﻿BELLATRIX,"It's the bank's policy. I'm sure you understand, given the current climate --"
﻿BELLATRIX,RON,Shut it! You. Goblin. Come with me.
﻿BELLATRIX,BOGROD,"No, I most certainly do not understand --"
BOGROD,HARRY,I'm afraid I must insist.
HARRY,BOGROD,"The door glides shut.	The wind dies.	Bogrod blinks."
BOGROD,AGED GOBLIN,"Very well, Madam Lestrange.	If you will follow me"
AGED GOBLIN,BOGROD,"But... Bogrod, there have been special instructions regarding the Lestrange vault."
BOGROD,AGED GOBLIN,"I'm fully aware of that.	I'm also aware the Lestranges are one of our oldest and most respected families."
AGED GOBLIN,BOGROD,"Yes, sir, but our instructions are very specific --"
BOGROD,HARRY,"Madam, if you will, I will escort you myself"
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,How long before they come after us?
GRIPHOOK,RON,Time will tell.
RON,GRIPHOOK,"What's that?	Up ahead"
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,I should have known --
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"What is that, Griphook? , What is that!"
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,Well done.You look like... you.
GRIPHOOK,RON,"The Thief's Downfall.	Washes away all enchantments.	Can be deadly."
RON,GRIPHOOK,You don't say
GRIPHOOK,BOGROD,No.
BOGROD,GRIPHOOK,What the devil are you all doing down here!
GRIPHOOK,BOGROD,We need him
BOGROD,RON,"Is this your doing, Griphook? You have no rights here anymore. When you gave up your keys, you "
RON,GRIPHOOK,Imperio!
GRIPHOOK,RON,Well done.
RON,HERMIONE,"Bloody hell.	That's a Welsh Green."
HERMIONE,GRIPHOOK,Go on.
RON,HERMIONE,It's been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise
HERMIONE,GRIPHOOK,"That's barbaric.	I"
GRIPHOOK,BOGROD,"We'll only have a few seconds.	In other words... they'll be no do- overs.	Understood?, Ready, Bogrod?"
BOGROD,HARRY,"Hm?	Oh.	Yes.	Of course."
HARRY,RON,Lumos!
RON,HERMIONE,Blimey…
HERMIONE,RON,No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real.
RON,HERMIONE,"Is it here, Harry?Can you feel anything?"
HERMIONE,GRIPHOOK,It's hot!
GRIPHOOK,HERMIONE,They've added Gemino and Flagrante Curses! Everything you touch will burn and multiply!
HERMIONE,GRIPHOOK,"Ron, your foot!"
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,"We'll be crushed!	Hurry!"
HERMIONE,HARRY,How're we going to reach it?
HARRY,RON,"Give me the sword!	The real one."
RON,HERMIONE,Keep going!
HERMIONE,RON,"Harry!	Behind you!"
RON,HERMIONE,IN HERE
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"We have a deal, Griphook."
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,I said I'd get you in. I never said anything about getting you out.
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"Griphook!	Griphook!"
GRIPHOOK,RON,"Thieves!	Help!	Thieves"
RON,HERMIONE,"Foul little git.	Least we've got Bogrod., That's unfortunate."
HERMIONE,RON,"We can't just stand here!	Who's got an idea?"
RON,HERMIONE,"You're asking us?	You're the brilliant one."
HERMIONE,RON,"I've got something.	But it's mad, "
HERMIONE,RON,Relashio!The IRON CUFFS on the dragon snap free
RON,HARRY,That's your idea?
HARRY,HERMIONE,Come on!
HERMIONE,RON,"It doesn't realize it's free! (trying out spells) Leviosa!	Aviatus!	Ex Cappa!"
RON,GRIPHOOK,"That was brilliant!	BRILLIANT!"
HARRY,RON,We're dropping
RON,HARRY,I say we jump
HERMIONE,RON,When?
HARRY,HERMIONE,Now!
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,"The boy has discovered our secret, Nagini. We must return to our hiding places and see if the others are safe."
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,"And you, my friend, must stay close..."
HARRY,RON,He Knows.
HARRY,RON,You know who. He knows we broke into Gringotts. He knows what we took. He knows we are hunting Horcruxes
HERMIONE,HARRY,How is it you
HARRY,HERMIONE,I saw him
HERMIONE,HARRY,"You let him in! Harry, you cant"
HARRY,HERMIONE,"I cant always help it, Hermione! Maybe I can. I don't know"
RON,HARRY,Never mind! What did you see?
HARRY,RON,Hes angry. But hes scared too. He is going to make sure the other Horcruxes are safe.
RON,HARRY,What happens when he finds out four are gone?
HARRY,RON,I reckon he'll do anything to stop us from finding the resty. There's more: one of them's at hogwarts
RON,HARRY,What?
HERMIONE,HARRY,You saw it?
HARRY,HERMIONE,"I saw the castle. And Rowena Ravenclaw. I think it must have something to with her. We have to go there, now."
HERMIONE,HARRY,Tonight? But we have to plan. We have to figure out what
HARRY,HERMIONE,"Honestly, Hermione, when have any of our plans actually worked? We plan, we get there and all hell breaks loose."
RON,HARRY,Fraid hes right. One problem: Snape's Headmaster now. We cant just walk in the front door.
HARRY,RON,We'll go to Hogsmeade. To Honeydukes. Take the secret passage in the cellar.
HARRY,RON,"There's something wrong with him. In the past, I could always follow his thoughts. Now everything feels disconnected."
RON,HARRY,Maybe its because of the Horcruxes. Maybe he's growing weaker. Maybe he's dying.
HARRY,RON,"No. It's more like he's wounded. If anything, he feels more dangerous."
HERMIONE,RON,They were ready for us.
DEATH EATER #1,HARRY,"We know you're here, Potter. There's no getting away"
DEATH EATER #1,HARRY,Prehaps you need some convincing
RON,HARRY,What's he mean by that?
HERMIONE,HARRY,"No, you'll give us away"
﻿DEATH EATER #2,HARRY,﻿It's him! He's down there!
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"In here, Potter."
RON,HERMIONE,Did you get a look at him! For a second I thought it was
HERMIONE,RON,I know
HERMIONE,HARRY,Harry! I can see you! In here!
ABERFORTH,HARRY,You bloody fools! What were you thinking coming here? Do you have any idea how dangerous it is
HARRY,ABERFORTH,You're Aberforth
HARRY,ABERFORTH,Dumbledore's brother. Its you I've been seeing--here. It's you who sent Dobby
ABERFORTH,HARRY,Where've you left him?
HARRY,ABERFORTH,He's dead
ABERFORTH,HARRY,Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf
HARRY,ABERFORTH,How'd you come by it?
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"Mundungus Fletcher,’bout a year ago."
HARRY,ABERFORTH,Dung had no right selling you that. It belonged to--
ABERFORTH,HARRY,Sirius. Albus told me. He also told me that you'd likely be hacked off if you ever found out I had it. But ask yourself where you'd be if I didn't.
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"Right then. Reckon you're hungry. Let's get you fed, then think of the best way to get you out of here."
HERMIONE,ABERFORTH,Do you hear much from the others? From the Order?
ABERFORTH,HERMIONE,The order is finished. You know who's won. Anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves.
HARRY,RON,We need to get into Hogwarts. Dumbledore gave us a job to do.
ABERFORTH,HARRY,Did he now? Nice job? Easy?
HARRY,ABERFORTH,We've been hunting Horcruxes. We think the last one's in the school. But we'll need your help getting in.
HARRY,ABERFORTH,"If we can find it and kill it, then we kill him, and then we can end this war once and for all. We need to get into Hogwarts tonight"
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"It's not a job my brother's given you, it's a suicide mission. Do yourself a favour boy. Go home. Live a little longer."
HARRY,ABERFORTH,"Dumbledore trusted me, to see this through."
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"What makes you think you can trust him! What makes you think you can believe anything my brother told you! In all the time you knew him, did he ever mention my name? Did he ever mention hers?"
HARRY,ABERFORTH,Why should he..
ABERFORTH,HARRY,Keep secrets? You tell me
HARRY,ABERFORTH,I only care about the Dumbledore I knew. I trusted him.
ABERFORTH,HARRY,Did you now? and why is that?
HARRY,ABERFORTH,I had no reason not to
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"That's a boy's answer. A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of a man who wont even tell him where to start. You're lying. Not just to me, which doesn't matter, but to yourself as well. That's what a fool does"
HARRY,ABERFORTH,You're drunk
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"You don't strike me as a fool, Mr. Potter. So I'll ask you again. There must be a reason. Why do yopu trust anything my brother ever said to you? Why?"
HARRY,ABERFORTH,"Because I need to. Because If I don't, I don't know who I am anymore. Iv lost too many people to lie down now. I'm not interested in what happened between you and your brother, I don't even care that you,ve given up. I trust the man I knew. Im going to see this through. I need to get into the castle tonight."
ABERFORTH,HARRY,You know what to do.
HARRY,ABERFORTH,Where've you sent her?
ABERFORTH,HARRY,You'll see soon enough
HERMIONE,ABERFORTH,"That's Ariana, isn't it? Your sister. She's beautiful."
ABERFORTH,HERMIONE,She'll always be beautiful.
HERMIONE,ABERFORTH,"She died very young, didn't she."
ABERFORTH,HERMIONE,"My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter, in his journey to find power, including her. She was devoted to him. He gave her everything, but time."
HERMIONE,ABERFORTH,Myr. Dumbledore..thank you.
HERMIONE,RON,"Did save our lives twice. Kept an eye on us in that mirror. That doesn't seem like someone who's given up, does it?"
HERMIONE,RON,She's coming back! And she's got someone with her!
RON,HERMIONE,Who's that with her? Bloody hell…
NEVILLE,HARRY,I knew you'd come! I told them all! Harry Potter would never abandon Hogwarts!
HERMIONE,NEVILLE,Neville….
HARRY,NEVILLE,"Neville, you look…."
NEVILLE,HARRY,like hell? I reckon. This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You'll see. Hermione! Ron!
NEVILLE,ABERFORTH,"Hey,Ab. There might be a couple more people on the way"
NEVILLE,HARRY,Well? Ready?
RON,NEVILLE,I don't remember this being on the Marauder's Map.
NEVILLE,RON,That's because it never existed till now. The seven secret passages were sealed off before the start of the year. This is the only way in or out now. The grounds are crawling with death eaters and dementors.
HERMIONE,NEVILLE,"How bad is it, Neville? With snape as headmaster."
NEVILLE,HERMIONE,Hardly ever see him. It's the carrows you have to watch out for.
HARRY,NEVILLE,The carrows?
NEVILLE,HARRY,"Brother and sister. They're in charge of discipline. Like punishment, the carrows."
HERMIONE,NEVILLE,They did that to you? But why?
NEVILLE,HERMIONE,Today's dark arts lesson had us practising the Cruciatus curse. On first years. I refused. Hogwarts has changed.
NEVILLE,RON,"Aw, c'mon. Don't be grim. We're all used to it by now. And the thing is, it helps when people stand up, gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry. C'mon, we're almost there."
NEVILLE,RON,"Let's have a bit of fun, shall we? "
SEAMUS,NEVILLE,"Not more of Aberforth's cooking, I hope. Be a surprise if we could digest it."
NEVILLE,NIGEL,Get the word out to Remus and the others that Harry's back.
NEVILLE,NIGEL,"Okay, Okay! Stand down! Let's not kill them before you know who gets the chance!"
NEVILLE,HARRY,"Right then.What's the plan,Harry?"
HARRY,NEVILLE,"Okay. There's something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle. It could help us defeat you know who."
NEVILLE,HARRY,What is it?
HARRY,NEVILLE,We don't know
DEAN,HARRY,Where is it?
HARRY,DEAN,Don't know that either.
HARRY,DEAN,I realize it's not much to go on
SEAMUS,HARRY,That's nothing to go on.
HARRY,SEAMUS,"I think it might have something to do with ravenclaw. It would be small, easy to conceal, valuable. Any ideas?"
LUNA,HARRY,"Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem."
RON,LUNA,"Oh, bloody hell. Here we go."
LUNA,RON,The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Hasn't anyone ever heard of it? It's quite famous.
CHO,LUNA,"Yes, but Lina, it's lost. For centuries now. There's not a person alive today who's seen it."
RON,CHO,Excuse me. But would someone tell me: what's a bloody diadem?
CHO,RON,"It's a kind of crown. You know, like a tiara."
CHO ,RON,"Ravenclaw's was rumored to have a magical properties, to enhance the wisdom of the wearer."
GINNY,HARRY,Harry.
HARRY,GINNY,Hey there.
RON,HERMIONE,"six months she hasn't seen me and it's like I'm frankie first year. I mean, I'm only her brother."
SEAMUS,RON,"Got loads of those, though, doesn't she? There's only one Harry."
RON,SEAMUS,"Shut up, Seamus."
NEVILLE,GINNY,"What is it, Ginny?"
GINNY,NEVILLE,Snape knows. He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.
SNAPE,STUDENTS,Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you here at this hour. It has come to my attention that earlier this evening... Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.
SNAPE,STUDENTS,I mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by rumor.
SNAPE,STUDENTS,"For myself and a few select members of the staff this comes as little surprise. We have, for some time, considered Mr. Potter's return to Hogwarts to be not only possible but inevitable. Consequently, in the past several months and under my specific direction, exhaustive defensive strategies have been employed to defeat any attempt Mr. Potter might make to breach these walls. But know this. Should anyone -- student or staff -- attempt to aid Mr. Potter, that person will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. Rest assured: So long as I am Headmaster at Hogwarts, Harry Potter will never again step foot in this castle."
SNAPE,STUDENTS,Now then. If anyone here has knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening... I invite them to step forward now.
HARRY,SNAPE,I think I can help you out with that
HARRY,SNAPE,"It would seem that, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, you have a bit of a security problem, Headmaster."
HARRY,SNAPE,And I'm afraid it's rather extensive.
HARRY,SNAPE,How dare you stand where he stood.
HARRY,SNAPE,"Tell them how it was that night. Tell then how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you... and killed him. Tell them!"
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,Coward! COWARD! And he didn't even stay to fight!
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,"Mr. Potter, do you mind telling me what you're doing here, which, I trust you realize, is an act of complete and utter lunacy?"
HARRY,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,I'm a Gryffindor.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,I thought it might have something to do with that.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,All right! Settle down! Settle down!
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,"It appears that your Headmaster, to use the common phrase, has done a bunk."
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,Potter...
VOLDEMORT,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,I know that many of you will want to fight. Some of you may even think this wise. But this is folly.
VOLDEMORT,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,I wish you no harm. I have great respect for the students of Hogwarts. I was once one myself after all. I ask for but one thing and if granted no magical blood shall be spilt...
VOLDEMORT,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,Give me Harry Potter. Do this and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched. Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded.
PANSY PARKINSON,VOLDEMORT,But he's there! Potter's there! Someone grab him!
FILCH,NORRIS,Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,FILCH,"They're supposed to be out of bed, you blithering idiot!"
FILCH,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,"Oh. Sorry, mum."
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,FILCH,"Wait! As it turns out, Mr. Filch, your arrival is most opportune. If you would, I'd like you to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin House from the Hall."
FILCH,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,"Right away. (stopping) Er, exactly where is it I'd be leadin’ em to, mum?"
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,FILCH,"(a thought, then...) The dungeons should do."
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,"I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter. What is it you need?"
HARRY,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,Time. As much as you can give me.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,Do what you have to do. I'll secure the castle.
HARRY,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,"Is that possible, Professor?"
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,"We teachers are rather good at magic, Potter. We've even been known to turn out a worthwhile witch or wizard on occasion."
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,I think it's time I ask a few of them to take their magic beyond the classroom. What d’you think?
HARRY,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,I think you're right.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,"By the way, Potter... (as he looks back) It's good to see you."
HARRY,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,"You, too, Professor."
NEVILLE,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,"Let me get this straight, Professor. You're giving us permission to do this?"
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,NEVILLE,"That is correct, Longbottom."
NEVILLE,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,To blow it up. Boom.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,NEVILLE,Boom.
NEVILLE,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,"Wicked. (a frown) Um... exactly how do you propose we do this, Professor?"
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,NEVILLE,Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnegan.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,NEVILLE,"As I recall, he has a particular proclivity for pyrotechnics."
SEAMUS,NEVILLE,I can bring'er down.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,NEVILLE,That's the spirit. Now off you go.
FLITWICK,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,"You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely."
MADAM SPROUT,FLITWICK,"That doesn't mean we can't hold him up. And his name is Voldemort, Filius. You might as well use it. He's going to try to kill you either way."
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,FLITWICK,Piertotum Locomotor!
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,STUDENTS,Hogwarts is threatened! Man the boundaries and protect us! Do your duty to our school!
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,STUDENTS,I've always wanted to use that spell.
TEACHERS,STUDENTS,Protego Maxima... Finato Duri... Repello Inimicum...
RON,HERMIONE,"Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking. It doesn't really matter if we find the Horcrux."
HARRY,HERMIONE,What're you saying?
HERMIONE,HARRY,Unless we can destroy it.
RON,HERMIONE,So we were thinking --
HERMIONE,HARRY,You were thinking. It's Ron's idea. And it's brilliant.
RON,HERMIONE,"You destroyed Tom Riddle's Diary with a Basilisk fang, right? Well, we know where we might find one, don't we?"
HARRY,HERMIONE,Okay. But take this. That way you can find me when you get back.
HERMIONE,HARRY,Where are you going?
HARRY,HERMIONE,Ravenclaw Common Room. Got to start somewhere.
LUNA,HARRY,Harry! Wait! I need to talk to you!
HARRY,LUNA,"I'm a bit preoccupied right now, Luna."
LUNA,HARRY,But you won't find anything where you're going. You're wasting your time.
HARRY,LUNA,"We'll talk later, Luna."
LUNA,HARRY,Harry --
HARRY,LUNA,Later.
LUNA,HARRY,HARRY POTTER! YOU LISTEN TO ME RIGHT NOW!
LUNA,HARRY,Don't you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem: There's not a person alive who's seen it.
LUNA,HARRY,"It's obvious, isn't it? We have to talk to someone who's dead."
LUNA,HARRY,"He's very impressive, isn't he?"
VOLDEMORT,THICKNESSE,They never learn. Such a pity.
VOLDEMORT,THICKNESSE,Begin.
THICKNESSE,VOLDEMORT,"But, my Lord, shouldn't we wait --"
FRED,LUNA,Nice night for it!
HARRY,FRED,"Okay, Luna. Who've you got in mind?"
SEAMUS,NEVILLE,That's it. I want a charge on each and every joist.
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,"You do know what you're doing, don't you, Seamus?"
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,Blimey.
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,Not good.
LUNA,HARRY,"If you're to find her, you'll find her down there."
HARRY,LUNA,Aren't you coming?
LUNA,HARRY,No. I think it best if you two talk alone. She's very shy.
KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT,DEAN,Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.
DEAN,KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT,"Yes, sir."
KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT,DEAN,"Dean! (as Dean stops) On second thought, tell Professor McGonagall we might need one or two more wands this side."
LUPIN,KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT,"It's the quality of one's conviction that determines success, not the number of one's followers."
KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT,DEAN,Who said that?
LUPIN,KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT,Me
LUPIN,TONKS,Speaking of quality.
LUPIN,TONKS,You shouldn't have. It's Teddy who needs you.
TONKS,LUPIN,He'll sleep'til dawn and snore like his father. It's you who needs me tonight.
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,It's you...
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,Ha! Ha!
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,Yeah! You and whose army!
SEAMUS,NEVILLE,Woah! Easy up there!
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,Sorry. (rubbing his elbow) Ow.
RON,HERMIONE,(in Parseltongue) Take me inside.
RON,HERMIONE,Harry talks in his sleep. Haven't you noticed?
HERMIONE,RON,No. Of course not.
RON,HERMIONE,I've never got this far before.
HERMIONE,RON,I'm scared.
RON,HERMIONE,Me too.
HERMIONE,RON,I didn't expect it to be like this.
RON,HERMIONE,What did you expect it to be like?
HERMIONE,RON,Not this.
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,"You're the Grey Lady, the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower."
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,I do not answer to that name.
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,"I'm sorry. It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena's daughter. Luna told me."
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,Are you a friend of Luna's?
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,Yes. She thought you might be able to help me.
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,You seek my mother's diadem.
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,Yes! That's right --
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,"Luna is kind. Unlike so many of the others, but she was wrong. I cannot help you."
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,Wait! Please!
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,Many have sought my mother's diadem. Its powers are legendary…
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,"But I don't care about its powers! Honestly --I don't seek it for myself! You have to believe me! I want to destroy it. That's what you want, isn't it, Helena? You want it destroyed."
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,"She thought I took it to hurt her. But I only wanted to be more like her, clever and wise. She wore it so beautifully, but on me... I grew to hate it... the pain I felt... the pain I feel even now…"
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,"I'll end your pain, Helena. Tell me where it is and I'll destroy it, I swear, on my mother's memory --"
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,"Another swore to destroy it, many years ago, a strange boy with a strange name…"
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,Tom Riddle --
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,But he lied.
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,He's lied to many people --
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,I know what he's done! I know who he is! He defiled it! With Dark Magic!
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,"Yes. That's right. But I can undo that, Helena. I can destroy it once and for all. But only if you tell me where he hid it. You know where he hid it, don't you, Helena? You just have to tell me. Please.Trust me."
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,"Strange... you remind me of him a bit…It's here. In the castle. In the place where everything is hidden...If you have to ask, you'll never know. If you know, you need only ask..."
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,Thank you…
RON,RON,"You do it. Yes, you can."
NEVILLE,GINNY,Not good.
GINNY,NEVILLE,Ready!?
NEVILLE,GINNY,Are you bloody joking?!
NEVILLE,NEVILLE,Oh God --
SEAMUS,SEAMUS,He's good...He's good…
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,"Well done, Seamus!"
SEAMUS,NEVILLE,Told yeh I'd bring'er down. 
GINNY,SEAMUS,What?
SEAMUS,GINNY,That was kind of exciting.
GINNY,SEAMUS,Mad. The both of you.
NEVILLE,GINNY,Not good.
FILCH,PANSY PARKINSON,Night-tee night.
PANSY PARKINSON,FILCH,"You let us out of here, you filthy squib!"
HARRY,NEVILLE ,Ginny! Neville! You alright?
NEVILLE,HARRY,"Never better! Feel like I could spit fire! Haven't seen Luna, have you?"
HARRY,GINNY,Luna -- ?
NEVILLE,HARRY,"I'm mad for her! Think it's about time I told her, seeing as there's a pretty good chance we'll both be dead by dawn!"
GINNY,HARRY,I know.
RON,HERMIONE,Bloody hell. We'll never find him on this.
HERMIONE,RON,There he is.
RON,HERMIONE,What? Brilliant.
HERMIONE,RON,He vanished. Just now. I saw it.
RON,HERMIONE,"He must've gone into the Room of Requirement. It doesn't show on the map, remember? You said so last year. That's right. I did. Let's go."
HERMIONE,RON,Brilliant
DRACO,RON,Take my hand.Now.
DRACO,HARRY,"Well, well, what brings you here, Potter?"
HARRY,DRACO,I could ask you the same.
DRACO,HARRY,I virtually lived here last year. Remember?
HARRY,DRACO,I remember.
DRACO,HARRY,You have something of mine. I'd like it back.
HARRY,DRACO,What's wrong with the one you have?
DRACO,HARRY,"It's my mother's. It's very powerful, but it's not the same. It doesn't... understand me. Know what I mean?"
HARRY,DRACO,Why didn't you tell her? Bellatrix. You knew it was me. But you didn't say anything
DRACO,HARRY,Give me my wand.
HARRY,DRACO,"No. I don't think so...Besides, its allegiance is to me now. If you want it, you'll have to win it back. Perhaps even kill me..."
GOYLE,DRACO,"C'mon, Draco. Don't be a prat. Just do' im."
GOYLE,GOYLE,Avada Kedavra!
HARRY,HARRY,Expelliarmus!
HERMIONE,HARRY,Did you see where it went? The diadem!
HARRY,HERMIONE,It's gone! We'll never -- Well done. Let's find Ron and get out of here.
RON,HERMIONE,RUN! Goyle's set the bloody place on fire!
HARRY,HERMIONE,Split up!
HERMIONE,HARRY,Do we climb!
HARRY,HERMIONE,"No, it'll just follow us! Here! Take one!"
RON,HERMIONE,Serves him right.
HERMIONE,HARRY,C'mon! This way!
HARRY,HERMIONE,Wait! What about Malfoy and Blaise!
RON,HERMIONE,"He's joking, right?"
RON,HARRY,"IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I'LL KILL YOU, HARRY!"
RON,HERMIONE,Brilliant.
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,Nagini. Come.
RON,DRACO,You're bloody well welcome! prat.
HARRY,RON,"Ron, you once asked me if I thought he felt it -- Voldemort -- when we destroy a Horcrux, when we destroy a piece of his soul."
RON,HARRY,Where will he take her?
HERMIONE,HARRY,Someplace safe.
HARRY,HERMIONE,No. He'll keep her close.
RON,HERMIONE,"Look inside him, Harry. Find out where he is. If we find him, we find the snake. Then we're one step closer to ending this."
VOLDEMORT,LUCIUS,Stop looking at her. She smells your fear. It agitates her. Be grateful she's just eaten.
﻿LUCIUS,VOLDEMORT,"Forgive me, my Lord, but wouldn't it be more prudent to call off this battle and seek the boy yourself?"
VOLDEMORT,LUCIUS,"I do not need to seek the boy! Before the night is out, he will come to me! Do you understand!"
﻿LUCIUS,VOLDEMORT,"Of c-course, my Lord."
VOLDEMORT,LUCIUS,"How do you live with yourself, Lucius?Go. Find Severus. Tell him I need to see him immediately."
HARRY,HERMIONE,I know where he is.
TRELAWNEY,SEAMUS,"There's more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan."
LUNA,NEVILLE,Thanks.
NEVILLE,LUNA,Don't mention it.
HERMIONE,FENRIR GREYBACK,No!
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,Why doesn't it work for me?
SNAPE,VOLDEMORT,"You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord. In the last few hours alone --"
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,No! I am extraordinary! But the wand resists me!
SNAPE,VOLDEMORT,"There is no wand more powerful. Ollivander himself said it. Tonight, when the boy comes to you, it will not fail you, I am sure. It answers to you and you only."
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,Does it?
SNAPE,VOLDEMORT,My Lord?
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,"The wand. Does it truly answer to me? You're a clever man, Severus. Where, Severus? Where does its loyalty lie? Surely you must know."
SNAPE,VOLDEMORT,"With you, of course, my Lord."
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,"The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to thewizard who killed its last owner. Ollivander was quite explicitabout that. You killedDumbledore, Severus. While youlive, the Elder Wand cannot betruly mine."
SNAPE,VOLDEMORT,My Lord --
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,"You have been a good and faithful servant, Severus. But only I can live forever…"
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,Kill. Nagini! Come!
SNAPE,HARRY,Take them… Take them! Please.
HARRY,HERMIONE,Give me something! Quickly! A flask! Anything.
SNAPE,HARRY,They are the same… You have your mother's eyes…
RON,HARRY,He's gone. The snake too.
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,"You have fought valiantly... but in vain. I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a terrible waste. I therefore command my forces to retreat. In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity.Treat your injured."
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,"Harry Potter, I speak now directly to you. On this night you have allowed your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. There is no greater dishonor. Join me in the Forbidden Forest and confront your fate. Should you do so I give my word that no other life will be lost on this night. You have one hour. If, at the end of that time, you have not given yourself up, then I shall punish every last man, woman and child who tries to conceal you from me."
RON,VOLDEMORT,Never! Do you hear me! NEVER!
HERMIONE,HARRY,Where is everyone?
SNAPE,SNAPE,Lily...
PETUNIA EVANS,LILY,Lily! Come out of there! Now! We're going home.
YOUNG SNAPE,LILY,She's jealous. Because she's ordinary and you're special.
LILY,SNAPE,That's mean.
YOUNG SNAPE,LILY,It's true. You know so yourself.
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,No! Don't kill me!
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"That wasn't my intention. Stand up, Severus. I haven't much time. What message do you bring from Lord Voldemort this time?"
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,None. I come on my own account. I come with a... request.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,Is this about the Prophecy?
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Yes.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,How much did you relay?
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Only what I heard. But now... he thinks it refers to her.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,The Prophecy did not refer to a woman. It spoke of a boy born at the end of July --
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Yes! But he thinks it's her son! He intends to hunt them down now! To kill them!
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"If she means so much to you, surely Lord Voldemort would spare her in exchange for the boy."
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,I have asked.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,You disgust me. You would sacrifice the life of an innocent child over a schoolboy crush?
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,She's more than that! She's different! Beautiful. Kind. Hide them all. I beg you.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"And should I do so, what will you give me in return, Severus?"
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Anything.
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,You said you would keep her safe!
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"Lily and James put their faith in the wrong person. Rather like you, Severus. The boy survives. He has her eyes."
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,DON't!
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"If you loved Lily Evans, Severus. If you truly loved her. Then your way is clear."
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,He doesn't need protection. The Dark Lord has gone --
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,The Dark Lord will return. And the boy will be in terrible danger when he does.
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,No one can know. Your word.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"My word that I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus? If you insist."
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,He exhibits no measurable talent. His arrogance rivals even his father's. And he seems to relish his fame.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"Sometimes we see what we expect to see, Severus. Other teachers indicate the boy is modest, likeable and while no prodigy, possesses above-average gifts. Personally, I find him rather engaging."
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,You see what you want to see.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"Perhaps. Oh. Severus. Keep an eye on Professor Quirrell, won't you?"
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Why did you put it on? Surely you realized it carried a curse.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,I was... foolish... greedy...
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Drink the rest. It will contain the curse to the hand for the time being.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,For the time being?
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Maybe a year.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"Well, this makes matters much more straightforward. Do not ignore me, Severus. Was it not you who told me of LordVoldemort's plan to have the Malfoy boy murder me?"
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,It is not expected that he will succeed.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"But should he fail, one would presume the Dark Lord will turn to... you. You must agree. Yes. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely."
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,You ask too much.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"Too much! Nothing I could ask is too much. You know what is at stake! You more than anyone! There will come a time when Harry 
Potter must be told something. 
But you must wait until Voldemort 
is at his most vulnerable."
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Tell him what?
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Lord Voldemort's soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find: Harry himself. There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's  mind. A part of Lord Voldemort lives inside him."
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,"So when the time comes, the boy must die."
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,Yes. And Voldemort himself must do it. That is essential.
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,You've kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment. You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"But this is touching, Severus. Don't tell me you've grown to care for the boy?"
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Expecto Patronum!
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,Lily. After all this time?
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Always...
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"The irony of course, Severus, is that -- in the end -- you and the boy desire the same thing..."
HERMIONE,HARRY,Where've you been?
RON,HARRY,"We thought you'd gone to the forest, we thought you might be --"
HARRY,RON,I'm going there now.
RON,HARRY,Are you mad! No!
HARRY,RON,It's... meant to be.
RON,HARRY,Rubbish! You can't just give yourself up to him --
HERMIONE,HARRY,"What is it, Harry? What is it you know?"
HARRY,HERMIONE,There's a reason I can... hear them -- the Horcruxes. I think I've known for awhile. I think you've known too.
HERMIONE,HARRY,I'll go with you. I'll --
HARRY,HERMIONE,Kill the snake. Kill the snake and then it's just him. Then it will be over.
OLIVER WOOD,NEVILLE,I'll take him from here.
GINNY,YOUNG GIRL,It's all right. We're going to get you inside.
YOUNG GIRL,GINNY,I kept calling. No one came.
GINNY,YOUNG GIRL,"Don't worry. I won't leave you.
I promise."
LILY,JAMES POTTER,"You've been so brave, sweetheart."
HARRY,JAMES POTTER,Why are you here? All of you?
LILY,JAMES POTTER,"We never left, dear."
HARRY,JAMES POTTER,Does it hurt? Dying?
SIRIUS BLACK,JAMES POTTER,Quicker than falling asleep.
LUPIN,JAMES POTTER,And he will want it to be quick.
JAMES POTTER,SIRIUS BLACK,"You're nearly there, son."
HARRY,JAMES POTTER,"I'm sorry. I didn't want any of you to die for me. And Remus, your son..."
LUPIN,JAMES POTTER,Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. Someday he'll understand...
HARRY,JAMES POTTER,You'll stay with me?
JAMES POTTER,SIRIUS BLACK,Until the end.
HARRY,JAMES POTTER,He won't be able to see you?
SIRIUS BLACK,JAMES POTTER,"No. We're here, you see."
HARRY,LILY,Stay close to me.
LILY,HARRY,Always…
YAXLEY,VOLDEMORT,"No sign of him, my Lord."
VOLDEMORT,YAXLEY,"I thought he would come. I was, it seems... mistaken."
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,You weren't.
HAGRID,HARRY,HARRY! NO! WHAT'RE YEH DOIN'ERE!
YAXLEY,HAGRID,Quiet!
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived. Come to die.
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,You cannot help.
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Sir, this, is this... I mean, forgive me, but you are dead, aren't you, sir?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Oh, yes."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,Then... I'm dead too?
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Ah. That is the question, isn't it? On the whole I think not."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,Not?
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,Not.
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,But I didn't defend myself. I let him kill me.
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"And that will, I think, have made all the difference. I suspect you now realize that you and Voldemort have been connected by something other than fate since that night in Godric's Hollow all those years ago, Harry."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"It's true, isn't it, sir? A bit of him lives in me, doesn't it?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,Did. It was just destroyed only moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself.
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry; the Horcrux he never meant to make"
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,And you knew this? That's why you were certain I wouldn't die?
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Certain? No. Little is certain in this world, Harry. Call it an educated guess."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Professor, is that -- ?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,Something beyond either of our help.
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Exactly where are we, sir?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are?
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,It looks like King's Cross station -- only a lot cleaner. And without the trains.
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"King's Cross! Is that right? Well, this is, as they say, your party."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Sir, why didn't you just tell me about the Deathly Hallows?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"You will have to forgive me, Harry. You see... I didn't trust you."
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"I feared that you would make the same mistake I made, that you would be intoxicated by the power the Hallows promise their possessor. But I crave your pardon, Harry. It's clear to me now, as it should have been all along, that you are the better man."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,Sir --
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows, Harry, not me. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, because I took it not for gain, but to
save others from it. But I took the Stone because I longed to recall someone who has long been at peace and for that I paid with my life."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"You wanted to see Ariana again, didn't you, sir?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,Yes.
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"I used the Stone as well, sir, only a little while ago when I entered the Forest. I saw my mum and dad, and Sirius and Lupin..."
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,True. But ask yourself this: were you calling them? Or were they calling you?
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"You are the true master of death, Harry, because the true master does not seek to run away from death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"I've got to go back, haven't I?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,That is up to you.
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,I've got a choice?
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Oh yes. We are in King's Cross, you say? I think, should you so decide, you would be able to, let's say, board a train."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,And where would it take me?
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,On.
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,Voldemort's got the Elder Wand.
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,True.
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,And the snake lives.
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,Yes.
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,And I've nothing to kill it with.
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"I have always prized my ability to turn a phrase -- words are, in my not so humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic, capable both of inflicting injury and remedying it. But I would -- in this case -- amend my original statement to this: Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who most deserve it...Assuming circumstances in the main are favorable to such an outcome, of course."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"With all due respect, sir, I think what we need here is a miracle."
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"I've never put much stock in miracles, Harry. On the other hand, I can attest wholly to the extensive advantages of a related phenomenon."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Which would be, sir?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,Luck.
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living and, above all, those who live without love."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Sir, my mother's Patronus. It was a doe, wasn't it? Just like Professor Snape's. Curious, don't you think?"
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Actually, if I think about it...it doesn't seem curious at all. I'll be going now, Harry."
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,Professor.
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry. But why should that mean that it is not real?"
NARCISSA,VOLDEMORT,Is he alive...?
﻿BELLATRIX,VOLDEMORT,"My lord, let me help you"
VOLDEMORT,﻿BELLATRIX,I do not require assistance.
﻿BELLATRIX,NARCISSA,The boy. Is he dead?
NARCISSA,VOLDEMORT,Is he alive? Draco?
SORTING HAT,NEVILLE,"Don't despair, Longbottom. I put you in Gryffindor for good reason..."
GINNY,NEVILLE,Who's that?
GINNY,NEVILLE,Hagrid's carrying?
GINNY,NEVILLE,"Neville, who is that?"
WEASLEY,NEVILLE,"What's going on here, Neville?"
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,"Behold, Nagini. Our work is done."
GINNY,RON,No... NO!
VOLDEMORT,RON,SILENCE!
VOLDEMORT,RON,Stupid girl. You cry for that?
VOLDEMORT,RON,Tell me. These last few hours -- as you collected the dead and tended your wounded -- was he by your side?
VOLDEMORT,RON,"While your hands ran dark with the blood of mothers and sons, fathers and daughters, brothers and sisters, his were clasped in prayer -- but it was a prayer for one and one only. While you battled courageously, until you could no longer will yourself to stand, he had long since fallen to his knees. While you cursed me until your voices grew ragged, he begged me for mercy in a voice as meek as a child's."
VOLDEMORT,RON,So do not cry for that. He's not worthy of your tears. And do not despair of his betrayal. You were never in his heart. Not for one single solitary beat.
RON,VOLDEMORT,Liar!
VOLDEMORT,RON,"Did you not hear me! Harry Potter is dead! From this day forward, you put your faith in me or suffer the consequences. HARRY POTTER IS DEAD!"
VOLDEMORT,RON,Now is the time to declare yourself.
﻿LUCIUS,DRACO,Draco…
﻿LUCIUS,DRACO,"Draco, don't be stupid"
NARCISSA,DRACO,"Come, Draco."
RON,DRACO,He saved your life.
VOLDEMORT,DRACO,"Well done, Draco. Who will be next? Hm? Come now, don't be shy."
VOLDEMORT,NEVILLE,"Well, I must say, I'd hoped for better. Is this truly the best Hogwarts has to offer?"
VOLDEMORT,NEVILLE,"Who might you be, young man?"
NEVILLE,VOLDEMORT,Neville Longbottom.
VOLDEMORT,NEVILLE,"Well, welcome, Neville. I'm sure we can find a place for you in our ranks."
﻿BELLATRIX,VOLDEMORT,Someone has to do the washing.
VOLDEMORT,﻿BELLATRIX,"Now, now, Bellatrix. Let's not underestimate our young friend. By stepping forward, he lives to see another day… "
NEVILLE,VOLDEMORT,I'd like to say something
VOLDEMORT,NEVILLE,"Very well, Neville. I'm sure we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say."
NEVILLE,VOLDEMORT,It doesn't matter that Harry is gone.
SEAMUS,NEVILLE,"Stand down, Neville!"
NEVILLE,VOLDEMORT,"People die every day. Friends. Family. Yes, we lost Harry tonight. But he's still with us, here -- And so is Fred and Remus and Tonks
and... all of them. They didn't die in vain. But you will. And you and you and you will. And so will you. Because you're
wrong. Harry's heart did beat for us. All of us..."
DRACO,HARRY,Potter!
RON,DRACO,"Well done, Malfoy! Can't believe I just said that."
HARRY,NAGINI,Confringo!
HARRY,RON,The snake! We've got to kill the snake!
NEVILLE,HARRY,Harry! Look out!
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,Nagini! With me!
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,Nagini Come with me.
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,Leave her.
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,Nagini 
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,Die Die
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,Why do you live?
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,Because I have something worth living for.
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,Confringo
WEASLEY,﻿BELLATRIX,"Not my daughter , You bitch ."
﻿BELLATRIX,WEASLEY,"Come on, Granny , give us your best."
WEASLEY,GEORGE,"Back off, boys . She's mine ."
WEASLEY,﻿BELLATRIX,You will never touch my children again.
﻿BELLATRIX,WEASLEY,"Be happy we took only one , besides It's not like you don't have a spare."
RON,HERMIONE,Hermonie
HERMIONE,RON,Yes
RON,HERMIONE,I need to tell you something
HERMIONE,RON,I don't want you to say anything you wouldn't say if we weren't about to be killed by a giant snake! It'll just ruin it 
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,You were right.
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,When you told Professor Snape it was failing you. It will always fail you. 
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,It belongs to me! I killed Snape!
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,But what if the wand never belonged to him? What if the wand's allegiance was to someone else?
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,"Come on, Tom. Let's end this the way we started it…"
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,Together.
HERMIONE,RON,What's the matter with her
TRELAWNEY,FINNEGAN,"There's more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan."
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,I told you: it's useless to you.
RON,HERMIONE,"Not exactly leaving the place better than we found it, are we?"
HERMIONE,RON,Can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.
HERMIONE,RON,Something my mum used to say.
HERMIONE,HARRY,Why didn't it work for him? The Elder wand.
HARRY,HERMIONE,Because it answers to another.
HARRY,HERMIONE,"When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his. But the thing is... it never belonged to Snape."
HARRY,RON,"It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore that night on the Astronomy Tower. From that moment on, the wand answered to him. Until the other night when I disarmed Draco."
RON,HARRY,But that means…
HARRY,RON,It answers to me.
RON,HARRY,What do you reckon we should do with it?
HERMIONE,RON,We.
RON,HERMIONE,"I'm just saying. That's the Elder Wand! It's the most powerful bloody wand in the world! With that, we could, we could --"
HARRY,HERMIONE,"Well, it wasn't boring, was it? "
OLDER HARRY ,ALBUS POTTER,Together?
OLDER HERMIONE ,HERMIONE'S DAUGHTER,Don't forget to give Professor Longbottom our best.
ALBUS POTTER,OLDER HARRY ,Will there really be thestrals pulling the carriages?
OLDER HARRY ,ALBUS POTTER,"There's nothing scary about thestrals. They're gentle things. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages. You'll be going in the boats, remember?"
ALBUS POTTER,OLDER HARRY ,Dad? 
OLDER HARRY ,ALBUS POTTER,Yes? 
ALBUS POTTER,OLDER HARRY ,What if I'm put in Slytherin?
OLDER HARRY ,ALBUS POTTER,Albus Severus Potter. You were named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin. And he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.
ALBUS POTTER,OLDER HARRY ,But just say I am 
OLDER HARRY ,ALBUS POTTER,"Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful wizard. But listen, if it means so much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account."
ALBUS POTTER,OLDER HARRY ,Really? 
OLDER HARRY ,ALBUS POTTER,Really?
