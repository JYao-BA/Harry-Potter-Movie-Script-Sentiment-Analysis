﻿BELLATRIX,﻿SCABIOR,﻿Or ran into a Stinging Jinx.,
﻿BELLATRIX,HERMIONE,"﻿Was it you, dearie? Give me her wand. We'll see what the last spell was. ﻿What is that?",
﻿BELLATRIX,﻿SNATCHER,﻿Where did you get that!,
﻿BELLATRIX,﻿SCABIOR,﻿Go. Go!,
﻿BELLATRIX,﻿WORMTAIL,﻿Wormtail. Put these two in the cellar. I want to have a little conversation with this one. Girl to girl.,
﻿BELLATRIX,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿This sword is meant to be in my vault at Gringotts. How did you get it?,

﻿BELLATRIX,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿I'm going to ask you once again: what else did you and your friends take from my vault!,
﻿BELLATRIX,GRIPHOOK,﻿Well?,

﻿BELLATRIX,GRIPHOOK,﻿Liar! You can't deceive me!,
﻿BELLATRIX,GOBLIN,"﻿Consider yourself lucky, Goblin. The same won't be said for this one.",

﻿DEATH EATER #2,HARRY,﻿It's him! He's down there!,
﻿LUCIUS,﻿BELLATRIX,﻿Why Draco?,
﻿LUCIUS,DRACO,"﻿Look close, Draco. If we're the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiven. Do you understand?",
﻿LUCIUS,VOLDEMORT,"Forgive me, my Lord, but wouldn't it be more prudent to call off this battle and seek the boy yourself?",
﻿LUCIUS,VOLDEMORT,"Of c-course, my Lord.",
﻿LUCIUS,DRACO,Draco…,
﻿LUCIUS,DRACO,"Draco, don't be stupid",
﻿SCABIOR,﻿BELLATRIX,﻿In the North Forest.,

AGED GOBLIN,BOGROD,"But... Bogrod, there have been special instructions regarding the Lestrange vault.",
AGED GOBLIN,BOGROD,"Yes, sir, but our instructions are very specific --",
BOGROD,﻿BELLATRIX,"Madam Lestrange.	Would you mind presenting your wand?",
BOGROD,﻿BELLATRIX,"It's the bank's policy. I'm sure you understand, given the current climate --",
BOGROD,HARRY,I'm afraid I must insist.,
BOGROD,AGED GOBLIN,"Very well, Madam Lestrange.	If you will follow me",
BOGROD,AGED GOBLIN,"I'm fully aware of that.	I'm also aware the Lestranges are one of our oldest and most respected families.",
BOGROD,HARRY,"Madam, if you will, I will escort you myself",
BOGROD,GRIPHOOK,What the devil are you all doing down here!,
BOGROD,RON,"Is this your doing, Griphook? You have no rights here anymore. When you gave up your keys, you ",

GRIPHOOK,HARRY,﻿Alive.,
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,"﻿that I showed you to your vault the first time you visited Gringotts? Even amongst goblins, you are famous, Harry Potter.﻿You buried the elf. I saw you.",
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,﻿And brought me here.,
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,﻿Why did you leave Gringotts?,
GRIPHOOK,RON,﻿This is a wizard's war. I take no side.,
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,﻿It is impossible.,
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,﻿How did you come by this sword?,
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,﻿It's complicated.,
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,"﻿There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault identical to this one, but it is a fake. It was placed there this past summer.",
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,﻿The replica is very convincing. Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.,
GRIPHOOK,RON,"﻿It was not my place to ask, nor did I desire to. There are more than a few curious things in the vaults at Gringotts.",
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,﻿Perhaps.,

GRIPHOOK,BOGROD,They know she's an imposter! They've been warned,
GRIPHOOK,RON,Time will tell.,

GRIPHOOK,BOGROD,No.,
GRIPHOOK,BOGROD,We need him,
GRIPHOOK,RON,Well done.,
GRIPHOOK,BOGROD,"We'll only have a few seconds.	In other words... they'll be no do- overs.	Understood?, Ready, Bogrod?",
GRIPHOOK,HERMIONE,They've added Gemino and Flagrante Curses! Everything you touch will burn and multiply!,
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,"We'll be crushed!	Hurry!",
GRIPHOOK,HARRY,I said I'd get you in. I never said anything about getting you out.,

VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,"And you, my friend, must stay close...",
VOLDEMORT,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,I know that many of you will want to fight. Some of you may even think this wise. But this is folly.,
VOLDEMORT,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,I wish you no harm. I have great respect for the students of Hogwarts. I was once one myself after all. I ask for but one thing and if granted no magical blood shall be spilt...,
VOLDEMORT,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,Give me Harry Potter. Do this and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched. Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded.,
VOLDEMORT,THICKNESSE,They never learn. Such a pity.,
VOLDEMORT,THICKNESSE,Begin.,
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,Nagini. Come.,
VOLDEMORT,LUCIUS,Stop looking at her. She smells your fear. It agitates her. Be grateful she's just eaten.,
VOLDEMORT,LUCIUS,"I do not need to seek the boy! Before the night is out, he will come to me! Do you understand!",
VOLDEMORT,LUCIUS,"How do you live with yourself, Lucius?Go. Find Severus. Tell him I need to see him immediately.",
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,Why doesn't it work for me?,
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,No! I am extraordinary! But the wand resists me!,
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,Does it?,
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,"The wand. Does it truly answer to me? You're a clever man, Severus. Where, Severus? Where does its loyalty lie? Surely you must know.",
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,"The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to thewizard who killed its last owner. Ollivander was quite explicitabout that. You killedDumbledore, Severus. While youlive, the Elder Wand cannot betruly mine.",
VOLDEMORT,SNAPE,"You have been a good and faithful servant, Severus. But only I can live forever…",
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,Kill. Nagini! Come!,
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,"You have fought valiantly... but in vain. I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a terrible waste. I therefore command my forces to retreat. In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity.Treat your injured.",
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,"Harry Potter, I speak now directly to you. On this night you have allowed your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. There is no greater dishonor. Join me in the Forbidden Forest and confront your fate. Should you do so I give my word that no other life will be lost on this night. You have one hour. If, at the end of that time, you have not given yourself up, then I shall punish every last man, woman and child who tries to conceal you from me.",
VOLDEMORT,YAXLEY,"I thought he would come. I was, it seems... mistaken.",
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived. Come to die.,
VOLDEMORT,﻿BELLATRIX,I do not require assistance.,
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,"Behold, Nagini. Our work is done.",
VOLDEMORT,RON,SILENCE!,
VOLDEMORT,RON,Stupid girl. You cry for that?,
VOLDEMORT,RON,Tell me. These last few hours -- as you collected the dead and tended your wounded -- was he by your side?,
VOLDEMORT,RON,"While your hands ran dark with the blood of mothers and sons, fathers and daughters, brothers and sisters, his were clasped in prayer -- but it was a prayer for one and one only. While you battled courageously, until you could no longer will yourself to stand, he had long since fallen to his knees. While you cursed me until your voices grew ragged, he begged me for mercy in a voice as meek as a child's.",
VOLDEMORT,RON,So do not cry for that. He's not worthy of your tears. And do not despair of his betrayal. You were never in his heart. Not for one single solitary beat.,
VOLDEMORT,RON,"Did you not hear me! Harry Potter is dead! From this day forward, you put your faith in me or suffer the consequences. HARRY POTTER IS DEAD!",
VOLDEMORT,RON,Now is the time to declare yourself.,
VOLDEMORT,DRACO,"Well done, Draco. Who will be next? Hm? Come now, don't be shy.",
VOLDEMORT,NEVILLE,"Well, I must say, I'd hoped for better. Is this truly the best Hogwarts has to offer?",
VOLDEMORT,NEVILLE,"Who might you be, young man?",
VOLDEMORT,NEVILLE,"Well, welcome, Neville. I'm sure we can find a place for you in our ranks.",
VOLDEMORT,﻿BELLATRIX,"Now, now, Bellatrix. Let's not underestimate our young friend. By stepping forward, he lives to see another day… ",
VOLDEMORT,NEVILLE,"Very well, Neville. I'm sure we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say.",
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,Nagini! With me!,
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,Nagini Come with me.,
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,Leave her.,
VOLDEMORT,NAGINI,Nagini ,
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,Die Die,
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,Why do you live?,
VOLDEMORT,HARRY,It belongs to me! I killed Snape!,
WARLOCK,﻿BELLATRIX,Madam Lestrange,
YAXLEY,VOLDEMORT,"No sign of him, my Lord.",
YAXLEY,HAGRID,Quiet!,
