﻿BILL,LUNA,﻿Fleur's seeing to Ollivander. Anyone else need tending,
﻿BILL,LUNA,"﻿It was our Aunt's. We used to come here as kids. The Order uses it now as a safe house -- what's left of us, at least.",
﻿BILL,HARRY,"﻿You're leaving, aren't you.",
﻿BILL,HARRY,﻿And Griphook?,
﻿BILL,HARRY,"﻿Listen, I don't know what you're up to, but I know goblins. If you've struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, you must be exceptionally careful to live up to it. If you don't... he won't be forgiving.",
﻿DOBBY,HARRY,"﻿Dobby has come to rescue Harry Potter, of course.",
﻿DOBBY,HARRY,﻿Of course. I'm an elf.,
﻿DOBBY,LUNA,﻿Like her very much.,
﻿DOBBY,RON,﻿Meet me at the top of the stairs in ten seconds.,
﻿DOBBY,HARRY,﻿Who gets his wand?,
﻿DOBBY,﻿BELLATRIX,"﻿Dobby meant only to maim or seriously injure, not kill.",
﻿DOBBY,LUNA,"﻿Dobby has no master! Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!",
﻿DOBBY,LUNA,﻿Such a beautiful night... to be with friends. Dobby is happy... to be with his friend... Harry Potter...,
﻿FLEUR,HARRY,﻿He's too weak.,
﻿FLEUR,HERMIONE,"﻿This is the closest I could find to what you described, Hermione.",
﻿OLLIVANDER,RON,﻿There's no way out. We've tried everything.,
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,﻿Forgive me if I don't get up.,
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,"﻿Anything, m'boy, anything.",
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,﻿Walnut and dragon heartstring. Twelve and three quarter inches. Unyielding. This belongs to Bellatrix Lestrange.,
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,﻿Hawthorn. Unicorn hair. Ten inches. Reasonably pliant. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.,
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,﻿Perhaps not -- if you won it from him. I sense its allegiance has changed.,
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,"﻿The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.",
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,"﻿There are rumored to be three: The Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak. It is said that to possess them all is to make oneself the Master of Death. But few truly believe such objects exist ",
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,﻿I see no reason to put stock in an old wives tale,
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,"﻿He tortured me! Besides, I conveyed only rumors. There's no guarantee he will find it --",
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,"﻿That's all, sir. We'll leave you to get some rest now.",
﻿OLLIVANDER,HARRY,"﻿Then I guess I'll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir.",
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"In here, Potter.",
ABERFORTH,HARRY,You bloody fools! What were you thinking coming here? Do you have any idea how dangerous it is,
ABERFORTH,HARRY,Where've you left him?,
ABERFORTH,HARRY,Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf,
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"Mundungus Fletcher,’bout a year ago.",
ABERFORTH,HARRY,Sirius. Albus told me. He also told me that you'd likely be hacked off if you ever found out I had it. But ask yourself where you'd be if I didn't.,
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"Right then. Reckon you're hungry. Let's get you fed, then think of the best way to get you out of here.",
ABERFORTH,HERMIONE,The order is finished. You know who's won. Anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves.,
ABERFORTH,HARRY,Did he now? Nice job? Easy?,
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"It's not a job my brother's given you, it's a suicide mission. Do yourself a favour boy. Go home. Live a little longer.",
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"What makes you think you can trust him! What makes you think you can believe anything my brother told you! In all the time you knew him, did he ever mention my name? Did he ever mention hers?",
ABERFORTH,HARRY,Keep secrets? You tell me,
ABERFORTH,HARRY,Did you now? and why is that?,
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"That's a boy's answer. A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of a man who wont even tell him where to start. You're lying. Not just to me, which doesn't matter, but to yourself as well. That's what a fool does",
ABERFORTH,HARRY,"You don't strike me as a fool, Mr. Potter. So I'll ask you again. There must be a reason. Why do yopu trust anything my brother ever said to you? Why?",
ABERFORTH,HARRY,You know what to do.,
ABERFORTH,HARRY,You'll see soon enough,
ABERFORTH,HERMIONE,She'll always be beautiful.,
ABERFORTH,HERMIONE,"My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter, in his journey to find power, including her. She was devoted to him. He gave her everything, but time.",
ALBUS POTTER,OLDER HARRY ,Will there really be thestrals pulling the carriages?,
ALBUS POTTER,OLDER HARRY ,Dad? ,
ALBUS POTTER,OLDER HARRY ,What if I'm put in Slytherin?,
ALBUS POTTER,OLDER HARRY ,But just say I am ,
ALBUS POTTER,OLDER HARRY ,Really? ,
CHO,LUNA,"Yes, but Lina, it's lost. For centuries now. There's not a person alive today who's seen it.",
CHO,RON,"It's a kind of crown. You know, like a tiara.",
CHO ,RON,"Ravenclaw's was rumored to have a magical properties, to enhance the wisdom of the wearer.",
DEAN,HARRY,Where is it?,
DEAN,KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT,"Yes, sir.",
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"That wasn't my intention. Stand up, Severus. I haven't much time. What message do you bring from Lord Voldemort this time?",
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,Is this about the Prophecy?,
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,How much did you relay?,
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,The Prophecy did not refer to a woman. It spoke of a boy born at the end of July --,
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"If she means so much to you, surely Lord Voldemort would spare her in exchange for the boy.",
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,You disgust me. You would sacrifice the life of an innocent child over a schoolboy crush?,
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"And should I do so, what will you give me in return, Severus?",
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"Lily and James put their faith in the wrong person. Rather like you, Severus. The boy survives. He has her eyes.",
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"If you loved Lily Evans, Severus. If you truly loved her. Then your way is clear.",
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,The Dark Lord will return. And the boy will be in terrible danger when he does.,
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"My word that I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus? If you insist.",
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"Sometimes we see what we expect to see, Severus. Other teachers indicate the boy is modest, likeable and while no prodigy, possesses above-average gifts. Personally, I find him rather engaging.",
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"Perhaps. Oh. Severus. Keep an eye on Professor Quirrell, won't you?",
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,I was... foolish... greedy...,
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,For the time being?,
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"Well, this makes matters much more straightforward. Do not ignore me, Severus. Was it not you who told me of LordVoldemort's plan to have the Malfoy boy murder me?",
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"But should he fail, one would presume the Dark Lord will turn to... you. You must agree. Yes. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely.",
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"Too much! Nothing I could ask is too much. You know what is at stake! You more than anyone! There will come a time when Harry 
Potter must be told something. 
But you must wait until Voldemort 
is at his most vulnerable.",
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Lord Voldemort's soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find: Harry himself. There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's  mind. A part of Lord Voldemort lives inside him.",
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,Yes. And Voldemort himself must do it. That is essential.,
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"But this is touching, Severus. Don't tell me you've grown to care for the boy?",
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,Lily. After all this time?,
DUMBLEDORE,SNAPE,"The irony of course, Severus, is that -- in the end -- you and the boy desire the same thing...",
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,You cannot help.,
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.",
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Oh, yes.",
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Ah. That is the question, isn't it? On the whole I think not.",
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,Not.,
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"And that will, I think, have made all the difference. I suspect you now realize that you and Voldemort have been connected by something other than fate since that night in Godric's Hollow all those years ago, Harry.",
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,Did. It was just destroyed only moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself.,
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry; the Horcrux he never meant to make",
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Certain? No. Little is certain in this world, Harry. Call it an educated guess.",
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,Something beyond either of our help.,
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are?,
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"King's Cross! Is that right? Well, this is, as they say, your party.",
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"You will have to forgive me, Harry. You see... I didn't trust you.",
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"I feared that you would make the same mistake I made, that you would be intoxicated by the power the Hallows promise their possessor. But I crave your pardon, Harry. It's clear to me now, as it should have been all along, that you are the better man.",
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows, Harry, not me. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, because I took it not for gain, but to
save others from it. But I took the Stone because I longed to recall someone who has long been at peace and for that I paid with my life.",
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,Yes.,
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,True. But ask yourself this: were you calling them? Or were they calling you?,
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"You are the true master of death, Harry, because the true master does not seek to run away from death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world.",
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,That is up to you.,
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Oh yes. We are in King's Cross, you say? I think, should you so decide, you would be able to, let's say, board a train.",
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,On.,
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,True.,
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,Yes.,
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.,
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"I have always prized my ability to turn a phrase -- words are, in my not so humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic, capable both of inflicting injury and remedying it. But I would -- in this case -- amend my original statement to this: Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who most deserve it...Assuming circumstances in the main are favorable to such an outcome, of course.",
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"I've never put much stock in miracles, Harry. On the other hand, I can attest wholly to the extensive advantages of a related phenomenon.",
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,Luck.,
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living and, above all, those who live without love.",
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Actually, if I think about it...it doesn't seem curious at all. I'll be going now, Harry.",
DUMBLEDORE,HARRY,"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry. But why should that mean that it is not real?",
FILCH,NORRIS,Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!,
FILCH,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,"Oh. Sorry, mum.",
FILCH,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,"Right away. (stopping) Er, exactly where is it I'd be leadin’ em to, mum?",
FILCH,PANSY PARKINSON,Night-tee night.,
FLITWICK,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,"You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.",
FRED,LUNA,Nice night for it!,
GINNY,HARRY,Harry.,
GINNY,NEVILLE,Snape knows. He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.,
GINNY,NEVILLE,Ready!?,
GINNY,SEAMUS,What?,
GINNY,SEAMUS,Mad. The both of you.,
GINNY,HARRY,I know.,
GINNY,YOUNG GIRL,It's all right. We're going to get you inside.,
GINNY,YOUNG GIRL,"Don't worry. I won't leave you.
I promise.",
GINNY,NEVILLE,Who's that?,
GINNY,NEVILLE,Hagrid's carrying?,
GINNY,NEVILLE,"Neville, who is that?",
GINNY,RON,No... NO!,
HAGRID,HARRY,HARRY! NO! WHAT'RE YEH DOIN'ERE!,
HARRY,HERMIONE,﻿What did you put on me?,
HARRY,HERMIONE,﻿How long will it last?,
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿Luna...?,
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿Hello, sir.",
HARRY,﻿DOBBY,﻿Dobby. What're you doing here?,
HARRY,﻿DOBBY,﻿Do you mean to say you can Apparate in and out of here? And take us with you?,
HARRY,﻿DOBBY,﻿Works for me.,
HARRY,﻿DOBBY,"﻿Right. Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander to",
HARRY,LUNA,﻿You'll see to Mr. Ollivander?,
HARRY,LUCIUS,﻿Stupefy!,
HARRY,LUCIUS,﻿Stupefy!,
HARRY,﻿DOBBY,﻿Give the Dark Lord our regards.,
HARRY,HERMIONE,"﻿It's all right, Hermione. You're safe. We're all safe.",
HARRY,LUNA,﻿Dobby... no...,
HARRY,LUNA,"﻿It's okay... Here... Just hold on, Dobby... I'll fix you -- Hermione -- your bag -- you must have something -- Essence of Dittany -- something... Hermione! Help me!",
HARRY,LUNA,﻿I want to bury him properly. Without magic.,
HARRY,LUNA,﻿I need to talk to the goblin.,
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿How are you?,
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿You probably don't remember --,
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿Yes.,
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿You are a very unusual wizard.,
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿Soon the Death Eaters will control it. That was unacceptable to me.,
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"﻿I need to get inside Gringotts, into one of the vaults.",
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"﻿Alone, yes. With you, no.",
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿It's complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault at Gringotts?,
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need. We didn't steal it.,
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿And she never suspected?,
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?,
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿I have gold. Lots of it.,
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿Then what?,
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,﻿All right.,
HARRY,HERMIONE,"﻿She was terrified when she thought we'd been in there. She kept asking you what else we'd taken. I'd bet anything there's a Horcrux there. If we find it, we can kill it. And if we kill it, we're one step closer to killing him.",
HARRY,RON,﻿I'm still working on that part.,
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions.",
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿Can you identify these, sir?",
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿And this?,
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿Was? Isn't it still?,
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿You talk about wands like they've got feelings. Can think.,
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿What do you know about the Deathly Hallows, sir?",
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿But you, sir? Do you believe they exist?",
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿You're lying. You know one exists and you told him about it. You told him about the Elder Wand and where to go looking for it.,
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿He has found it, sir.",
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿He's after you, Mr. Potter. If it's true, what you say, that he has the Elder Wand, I'm afraid you really don't stand a chance.",
HARRY,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿Then I guess I'll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir.",
HARRY,HERMIONE,﻿I reckon you should take this then.,
HARRY,HERMIONE,"﻿If I can hold it, you can.",
HARRY,RON,﻿I'll know. I can't explain. It's like...they sing to me.,
HARRY,HERMIONE,﻿No. I just know. When one's near.,
HARRY,﻿BILL,﻿In the morning.,
HARRY,﻿BILL,﻿He'll be leaving too.,
HARRY,LUNA,"Here Lies Dobby, A Free Elf.",
HARRY,LUNA,"looks up, finds her standing there clutching a small TRAVELING BAG, staring at Dobby's stone.",
HARRY,LUNA,"Yeah.	Funny. Listen, Luna, about your father, I don't want you to think I --.",
HARRY,LUNA,"Hogwarts? It's not the place you left, you know.	It's not the same.",
HARRY,RON,Wouldn't know you if I didn't know you.,
HARRY,RON,"Sirius gave it to me.	He had a matching piece.	He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it.",
HARRY,RON,"Something like that.	I don't know.	He died before I ever got to use it.	The thing is…",
HARRY,RON,"You'll think I'm mental, but more than once, when I've looked into it -- I think I've seen Dumbledore.",
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"Eyes up, who is studying the sword",
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"You can give that to Hermione to hold, all right, Griphook",
HARRY,HERMIONE,"C'mon.	Let's do it.",
HARRY,BOGROD,"The door glides shut.	The wind dies.	Bogrod blinks.",
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,How long before they come after us?,
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"What is that, Griphook? , What is that!",
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,Well done.You look like... you.,
HARRY,RON,Lumos!,
HARRY,RON,"Give me the sword!	The real one.",
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"We have a deal, Griphook.",
HARRY,GRIPHOOK,"Griphook!	Griphook!",
HARRY,HERMIONE,Come on!,
HARRY,RON,We're dropping,
HARRY,HERMIONE,Now!,
HARRY,RON,He Knows.,
HARRY,RON,You know who. He knows we broke into Gringotts. He knows what we took. He knows we are hunting Horcruxes,
HARRY,HERMIONE,I saw him,
HARRY,HERMIONE,"I cant always help it, Hermione! Maybe I can. I don't know",
HARRY,RON,Hes angry. But hes scared too. He is going to make sure the other Horcruxes are safe.,
HARRY,RON,I reckon he'll do anything to stop us from finding the resty. There's more: one of them's at hogwarts,
HARRY,HERMIONE,"I saw the castle. And Rowena Ravenclaw. I think it must have something to with her. We have to go there, now.",
HARRY,HERMIONE,"Honestly, Hermione, when have any of our plans actually worked? We plan, we get there and all hell breaks loose.",
HARRY,RON,We'll go to Hogsmeade. To Honeydukes. Take the secret passage in the cellar.,
HARRY,RON,"There's something wrong with him. In the past, I could always follow his thoughts. Now everything feels disconnected.",
HARRY,RON,"No. It's more like he's wounded. If anything, he feels more dangerous.",
HARRY,ABERFORTH,You're Aberforth,
HARRY,ABERFORTH,Dumbledore's brother. Its you I've been seeing--here. It's you who sent Dobby,
HARRY,ABERFORTH,He's dead,
HARRY,ABERFORTH,How'd you come by it?,
HARRY,ABERFORTH,Dung had no right selling you that. It belonged to--,
HARRY,RON,We need to get into Hogwarts. Dumbledore gave us a job to do.,
HARRY,ABERFORTH,We've been hunting Horcruxes. We think the last one's in the school. But we'll need your help getting in.,
HARRY,ABERFORTH,"If we can find it and kill it, then we kill him, and then we can end this war once and for all. We need to get into Hogwarts tonight",
HARRY,ABERFORTH,"Dumbledore trusted me, to see this through.",
HARRY,ABERFORTH,Why should he..,
HARRY,ABERFORTH,I only care about the Dumbledore I knew. I trusted him.,
HARRY,ABERFORTH,I had no reason not to,
HARRY,ABERFORTH,You're drunk,
HARRY,ABERFORTH,"Because I need to. Because If I don't, I don't know who I am anymore. Iv lost too many people to lie down now. I'm not interested in what happened between you and your brother, I don't even care that you,ve given up. I trust the man I knew. Im going to see this through. I need to get into the castle tonight.",
HARRY,ABERFORTH,Where've you sent her?,
HARRY,NEVILLE,"Neville, you look….",
HARRY,NEVILLE,The carrows?,
HARRY,NEVILLE,"Okay. There's something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle. It could help us defeat you know who.",
HARRY,NEVILLE,We don't know,
HARRY,DEAN,Don't know that either.,
HARRY,DEAN,I realize it's not much to go on,
HARRY,SEAMUS,"I think it might have something to do with ravenclaw. It would be small, easy to conceal, valuable. Any ideas?",
HARRY,GINNY,Hey there.,
HARRY,SNAPE,I think I can help you out with that,
HARRY,SNAPE,"It would seem that, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, you have a bit of a security problem, Headmaster.",
HARRY,SNAPE,And I'm afraid it's rather extensive.,
HARRY,SNAPE,How dare you stand where he stood.,
HARRY,SNAPE,"Tell them how it was that night. Tell then how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you... and killed him. Tell them!",
HARRY,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,I'm a Gryffindor.,
HARRY,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,Time. As much as you can give me.,
HARRY,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,"Is that possible, Professor?",
HARRY,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,I think you're right.,
HARRY,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,"You, too, Professor.",
HARRY,HERMIONE,What're you saying?,
HARRY,HERMIONE,Okay. But take this. That way you can find me when you get back.,
HARRY,HERMIONE,Ravenclaw Common Room. Got to start somewhere.,
HARRY,LUNA,"I'm a bit preoccupied right now, Luna.",
HARRY,LUNA,"We'll talk later, Luna.",
HARRY,LUNA,Later.,
HARRY,FRED,"Okay, Luna. Who've you got in mind?",
HARRY,LUNA,Aren't you coming?,
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,It's you...,
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,"You're the Grey Lady, the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.",
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,"I'm sorry. It's Helena, isn't it? Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena's daughter. Luna told me.",
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,Yes. She thought you might be able to help me.,
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,Yes! That's right --,
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,Wait! Please!,
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,"But I don't care about its powers! Honestly --I don't seek it for myself! You have to believe me! I want to destroy it. That's what you want, isn't it, Helena? You want it destroyed.",
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,"I'll end your pain, Helena. Tell me where it is and I'll destroy it, I swear, on my mother's memory --",
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,Tom Riddle --,
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,He's lied to many people --,
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,"Yes. That's right. But I can undo that, Helena. I can destroy it once and for all. But only if you tell me where he hid it. You know where he hid it, don't you, Helena? You just have to tell me. Please.Trust me.",
HARRY,THE GREY LADY,Thank you…,
HARRY,NEVILLE ,Ginny! Neville! You alright?,
HARRY,GINNY,Luna -- ?,
HARRY,DRACO,I could ask you the same.,
HARRY,DRACO,I remember.,
HARRY,DRACO,What's wrong with the one you have?,
HARRY,DRACO,Why didn't you tell her? Bellatrix. You knew it was me. But you didn't say anything,
HARRY,DRACO,"No. I don't think so...Besides, its allegiance is to me now. If you want it, you'll have to win it back. Perhaps even kill me...",
HARRY,HARRY,Expelliarmus!,
HARRY,HERMIONE,It's gone! We'll never -- Well done. Let's find Ron and get out of here.,
HARRY,HERMIONE,Split up!,
HARRY,HERMIONE,"No, it'll just follow us! Here! Take one!",
HARRY,HERMIONE,Wait! What about Malfoy and Blaise!,
HARRY,RON,"Ron, you once asked me if I thought he felt it -- Voldemort -- when we destroy a Horcrux, when we destroy a piece of his soul.",
HARRY,HERMIONE,No. He'll keep her close.,
HARRY,HERMIONE,I know where he is.,
HARRY,HERMIONE,Give me something! Quickly! A flask! Anything.,
HARRY,RON,I'm going there now.,
HARRY,RON,It's... meant to be.,
HARRY,HERMIONE,There's a reason I can... hear them -- the Horcruxes. I think I've known for awhile. I think you've known too.,
HARRY,HERMIONE,Kill the snake. Kill the snake and then it's just him. Then it will be over.,
HARRY,JAMES POTTER,Why are you here? All of you?,
HARRY,JAMES POTTER,Does it hurt? Dying?,
HARRY,JAMES POTTER,"I'm sorry. I didn't want any of you to die for me. And Remus, your son...",
HARRY,JAMES POTTER,You'll stay with me?,
HARRY,JAMES POTTER,He won't be able to see you?,
HARRY,LILY,Stay close to me.,
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,You weren't.,
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Sir, this, is this... I mean, forgive me, but you are dead, aren't you, sir?",
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,Then... I'm dead too?,
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,Not?,
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,But I didn't defend myself. I let him kill me.,
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"It's true, isn't it, sir? A bit of him lives in me, doesn't it?",
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,And you knew this? That's why you were certain I wouldn't die?,
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Professor, is that -- ?",
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Exactly where are we, sir?",
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,It looks like King's Cross station -- only a lot cleaner. And without the trains.,
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Sir, why didn't you just tell me about the Deathly Hallows?",
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,Sir --,
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"You wanted to see Ariana again, didn't you, sir?",
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"I used the Stone as well, sir, only a little while ago when I entered the Forest. I saw my mum and dad, and Sirius and Lupin...",
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"I've got to go back, haven't I?",
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,I've got a choice?,
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,And where would it take me?,
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,Voldemort's got the Elder Wand.,
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,And the snake lives.,
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,And I've nothing to kill it with.,
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"With all due respect, sir, I think what we need here is a miracle.",
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Which would be, sir?",
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,"Sir, my mother's Patronus. It was a doe, wasn't it? Just like Professor Snape's. Curious, don't you think?",
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,Professor.,
HARRY,DUMBLEDORE,Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?,
HARRY,NAGINI,Confringo!,
HARRY,RON,The snake! We've got to kill the snake!,
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,Because I have something worth living for.,
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,Confringo,
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,You were right.,
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,When you told Professor Snape it was failing you. It will always fail you. ,
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,But what if the wand never belonged to him? What if the wand's allegiance was to someone else?,
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,"Come on, Tom. Let's end this the way we started it…",
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,Together.,
HARRY,VOLDEMORT,I told you: it's useless to you.,
HARRY,HERMIONE,Because it answers to another.,
HARRY,HERMIONE,"When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his. But the thing is... it never belonged to Snape.",
HARRY,RON,"It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore that night on the Astronomy Tower. From that moment on, the wand answered to him. Until the other night when I disarmed Draco.",
HARRY,RON,It answers to me.,
HARRY,HERMIONE,"Well, it wasn't boring, was it? ",
HERMIONE,HARRY,﻿A Stinging Jinx.,
HERMIONE,HARRY,﻿Not long.,
HERMIONE,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿I don't know what you're talking about.,
HERMIONE,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿I told you. I don't know what you're talking,
HERMIONE,HARRY,"﻿Harry, are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?",
HERMIONE,RON,﻿Positive.,
HERMIONE,HARRY,﻿Can't I use the other?,
HERMIONE,RON,﻿But I hate that thing -- that's the wand that killed Sirius! How can I hold it and not feel...,
HERMIONE,HARRY,"﻿It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why --",
HERMIONE,﻿FLEUR,"﻿It's perfect. Thank you, Fleur.",
HERMIONE,HARRY,"He's right.	I was being stupid.",
HERMIONE,AGED GOBLIN,I wish to enter my vault.,
HERMIONE,GRIPHOOK,Go on.,
HERMIONE,GRIPHOOK,"That's barbaric.	I",
HERMIONE,RON,No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real.,
HERMIONE,GRIPHOOK,It's hot!,
HERMIONE,GRIPHOOK,"Ron, your foot!",
HERMIONE,HARRY,How're we going to reach it?,
HERMIONE,RON,"Harry!	Behind you!",
HERMIONE,RON,"We can't just stand here!	Who's got an idea?",
HERMIONE,RON,"I've got something.	But it's mad, ",
HERMIONE,RON,Relashio!The IRON CUFFS on the dragon snap free,
HERMIONE,RON,"It doesn't realize it's free! (trying out spells) Leviosa!	Aviatus!	Ex Cappa!",
HERMIONE,RON,When?,
HERMIONE,HARRY,How is it you,
HERMIONE,HARRY,"You let him in! Harry, you cant",
HERMIONE,HARRY,You saw it?,
HERMIONE,HARRY,Tonight? But we have to plan. We have to figure out what,
HERMIONE,RON,They were ready for us.,
HERMIONE,HARRY,"No, you'll give us away",
HERMIONE,RON,I know,
HERMIONE,HARRY,Harry! I can see you! In here!,
HERMIONE,ABERFORTH,Do you hear much from the others? From the Order?,
HERMIONE,ABERFORTH,"That's Ariana, isn't it? Your sister. She's beautiful.",
HERMIONE,ABERFORTH,"She died very young, didn't she.",
HERMIONE,ABERFORTH,Myr. Dumbledore..thank you.,
HERMIONE,RON,"Did save our lives twice. Kept an eye on us in that mirror. That doesn't seem like someone who's given up, does it?",
HERMIONE,RON,She's coming back! And she's got someone with her!,
HERMIONE,NEVILLE,Neville….,
HERMIONE,NEVILLE,"How bad is it, Neville? With snape as headmaster.",
HERMIONE,NEVILLE,They did that to you? But why?,
HERMIONE,HARRY,Unless we can destroy it.,
HERMIONE,HARRY,You were thinking. It's Ron's idea. And it's brilliant.,
HERMIONE,HARRY,Where are you going?,
HERMIONE,RON,No. Of course not.,
HERMIONE,RON,I'm scared.,
HERMIONE,RON,I didn't expect it to be like this.,
HERMIONE,RON,Not this.,
HERMIONE,RON,There he is.,
HERMIONE,RON,He vanished. Just now. I saw it.,
HERMIONE,RON,Brilliant,
HERMIONE,HARRY,Did you see where it went? The diadem!,
HERMIONE,HARRY,Do we climb!,
HERMIONE,HARRY,C'mon! This way!,
HERMIONE,HARRY,Someplace safe.,
HERMIONE,FENRIR GREYBACK,No!,
HERMIONE,HARRY,Where is everyone?,
HERMIONE,HARRY,Where've you been?,
HERMIONE,HARRY,"What is it, Harry? What is it you know?",
HERMIONE,HARRY,I'll go with you. I'll --,
HERMIONE,RON,Yes,
HERMIONE,RON,I don't want you to say anything you wouldn't say if we weren't about to be killed by a giant snake! It'll just ruin it ,
HERMIONE,RON,What's the matter with her,
HERMIONE,RON,Can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.,
HERMIONE,RON,Something my mum used to say.,
HERMIONE,HARRY,Why didn't it work for him? The Elder wand.,
HERMIONE,RON,We.,
JAMES POTTER,SIRIUS BLACK,"You're nearly there, son.",
JAMES POTTER,SIRIUS BLACK,Until the end.,
KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT,DEAN,Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.,
KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT,DEAN,"Dean! (as Dean stops) On second thought, tell Professor McGonagall we might need one or two more wands this side.",
KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT,DEAN,Who said that?,
LILY,SNAPE,That's mean.,
LILY,JAMES POTTER,"You've been so brave, sweetheart.",
LILY,JAMES POTTER,"We never left, dear.",
LILY,HARRY,Always…,
LUNA,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿Ron? Harry...?,
LUNA,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿You look strange, Harry. Mr. Ollivander, look who's here. It's Harry Potter.",
LUNA,HARRY,"﻿You're bleeding, Harry.",
LUNA,HARRY,﻿That's a curious thing to hide in your sock.,
LUNA,HARRY,"﻿You were hiding it, weren't you?",
LUNA,HARRY,﻿Of course.,
LUNA,﻿DOBBY,"﻿Whenever you're ready, sir.",
LUNA,LUNA,﻿We should close his eyes. Don't you think?,
LUNA,LUNA,"﻿There. Now he could be sleeping. She turns then, looks at Harry.",
LUNA,LUNA,﻿Harry. It's all right. That it hurts. That's what reminds us how lucky we are to be alive.,
LUNA,LUNA,﻿It's beautiful here.,
LUNA,LUNA,﻿Muggles think these keep evil away. But they're wrong...,
LUNA,HARRY,The sky has lost a star.Luna's image skitters across the mirror's surface ,
LUNA,HARRY,"My father used to say that when a child died.She looks up, smiles.",
LUNA,HARRY,Funny how Mr. Dobby knew exactly where to find us.,
LUNA,HARRY,"I know you understand why my father did what he did, Harry. That's why we don't need to talk about it.",
LUNA,HARRY,"Neither am I.She gives a little wave, still bearing the trace of a smile, then DISAPPARATES and is gone",
LUNA,HARRY,"Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem.",
LUNA,RON,The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Hasn't anyone ever heard of it? It's quite famous.,
LUNA,HARRY,Harry! Wait! I need to talk to you!,
LUNA,HARRY,But you won't find anything where you're going. You're wasting your time.,
LUNA,HARRY,Harry --,
LUNA,HARRY,HARRY POTTER! YOU LISTEN TO ME RIGHT NOW!,
LUNA,HARRY,Don't you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem: There's not a person alive who's seen it.,
LUNA,HARRY,"It's obvious, isn't it? We have to talk to someone who's dead.",
LUNA,HARRY,"He's very impressive, isn't he?",
LUNA,HARRY,"If you're to find her, you'll find her down there.",
LUNA,HARRY,No. I think it best if you two talk alone. She's very shy.,
LUNA,NEVILLE,Thanks.,
LUPIN,KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT,"It's the quality of one's conviction that determines success, not the number of one's followers.",
LUPIN,KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT,Me,
LUPIN,TONKS,Speaking of quality.,
LUPIN,TONKS,You shouldn't have. It's Teddy who needs you.,
LUPIN,JAMES POTTER,And he will want it to be quick.,
LUPIN,JAMES POTTER,Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. Someday he'll understand...,
MADAM SPROUT,FLITWICK,"That doesn't mean we can't hold him up. And his name is Voldemort, Filius. You might as well use it. He's going to try to kill you either way.",
NEVILLE,HARRY,I knew you'd come! I told them all! Harry Potter would never abandon Hogwarts!,
NEVILLE,HARRY,like hell? I reckon. This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You'll see. Hermione! Ron!,
NEVILLE,ABERFORTH,"Hey,Ab. There might be a couple more people on the way",
NEVILLE,HARRY,Well? Ready?,
NEVILLE,RON,That's because it never existed till now. The seven secret passages were sealed off before the start of the year. This is the only way in or out now. The grounds are crawling with death eaters and dementors.,
NEVILLE,HERMIONE,Hardly ever see him. It's the carrows you have to watch out for.,
NEVILLE,HARRY,"Brother and sister. They're in charge of discipline. Like punishment, the carrows.",
NEVILLE,HERMIONE,Today's dark arts lesson had us practising the Cruciatus curse. On first years. I refused. Hogwarts has changed.,
NEVILLE,RON,"Aw, c'mon. Don't be grim. We're all used to it by now. And the thing is, it helps when people stand up, gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry. C'mon, we're almost there.",
NEVILLE,RON,"Let's have a bit of fun, shall we? ",
NEVILLE,NIGEL,Get the word out to Remus and the others that Harry's back.,
NEVILLE,NIGEL,"Okay, Okay! Stand down! Let's not kill them before you know who gets the chance!",
NEVILLE,HARRY,"Right then.What's the plan,Harry?",
NEVILLE,HARRY,What is it?,
NEVILLE,GINNY,"What is it, Ginny?",
NEVILLE,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,"Let me get this straight, Professor. You're giving us permission to do this?",
NEVILLE,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,To blow it up. Boom.,
NEVILLE,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,"Wicked. (a frown) Um... exactly how do you propose we do this, Professor?",
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,"You do know what you're doing, don't you, Seamus?",
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,Blimey.,
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,Not good.,
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,Ha! Ha!,
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,Yeah! You and whose army!,
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,Sorry. (rubbing his elbow) Ow.,
NEVILLE,GINNY,Not good.,
NEVILLE,GINNY,Are you bloody joking?!,
NEVILLE,NEVILLE,Oh God --,
NEVILLE,SEAMUS,"Well done, Seamus!",
NEVILLE,GINNY,Not good.,
NEVILLE,HARRY,"Never better! Feel like I could spit fire! Haven't seen Luna, have you?",
NEVILLE,HARRY,"I'm mad for her! Think it's about time I told her, seeing as there's a pretty good chance we'll both be dead by dawn!",
NEVILLE,LUNA,Don't mention it.,
NEVILLE,VOLDEMORT,Neville Longbottom.,
NEVILLE,VOLDEMORT,I'd like to say something,
NEVILLE,VOLDEMORT,It doesn't matter that Harry is gone.,
NEVILLE,VOLDEMORT,"People die every day. Friends. Family. Yes, we lost Harry tonight. But he's still with us, here -- And so is Fred and Remus and Tonks
and... all of them. They didn't die in vain. But you will. And you and you and you will. And so will you. Because you're
wrong. Harry's heart did beat for us. All of us...",
NEVILLE,HARRY,Harry! Look out!,
OLDER HARRY ,ALBUS POTTER,Together?,
OLDER HARRY ,ALBUS POTTER,"There's nothing scary about thestrals. They're gentle things. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages. You'll be going in the boats, remember?",
OLDER HARRY ,ALBUS POTTER,Yes? ,
OLDER HARRY ,ALBUS POTTER,Albus Severus Potter. You were named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin. And he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.,
OLDER HARRY ,ALBUS POTTER,"Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful wizard. But listen, if it means so much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.",
OLDER HARRY ,ALBUS POTTER,Really? ,
OLDER HERMIONE ,HERMIONE'S DAUGHTER,Don't forget to give Professor Longbottom our best.,
OLIVER WOOD,NEVILLE,I'll take him from here.,
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,Coward! COWARD! And he didn't even stay to fight!,
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,"Mr. Potter, do you mind telling me what you're doing here, which, I trust you realize, is an act of complete and utter lunacy?",
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,I thought it might have something to do with that.,
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,All right! Settle down! Settle down!,
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,"It appears that your Headmaster, to use the common phrase, has done a bunk.",
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,Potter...,
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,FILCH,"They're supposed to be out of bed, you blithering idiot!",
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,FILCH,"Wait! As it turns out, Mr. Filch, your arrival is most opportune. If you would, I'd like you to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin House from the Hall.",
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,FILCH,"(a thought, then...) The dungeons should do.",
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,"I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter. What is it you need?",
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,Do what you have to do. I'll secure the castle.,
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,"We teachers are rather good at magic, Potter. We've even been known to turn out a worthwhile witch or wizard on occasion.",
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,I think it's time I ask a few of them to take their magic beyond the classroom. What d’you think?,
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,HARRY,"By the way, Potter... (as he looks back) It's good to see you.",
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,NEVILLE,"That is correct, Longbottom.",
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,NEVILLE,Boom.,
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,NEVILLE,Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnegan.,
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,NEVILLE,"As I recall, he has a particular proclivity for pyrotechnics.",
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,NEVILLE,That's the spirit. Now off you go.,
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,FLITWICK,Piertotum Locomotor!,
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,STUDENTS,Hogwarts is threatened! Man the boundaries and protect us! Do your duty to our school!,
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL,STUDENTS,I've always wanted to use that spell.,
RON,﻿OLLIVANDER,﻿Harry! What're we going to do? We can't just leave Hermione alone with her!,
RON,﻿OLLIVANDER,"﻿We have to do something, Harry!",
RON,﻿WORMTAIL,﻿Let her go! Let her go!,
RON,HARRY,﻿Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth. ﻿Trust me.,
RON,﻿BELLATRIX,﻿Like hell! ﻿Expelliarmus!,
RON,﻿BELLATRIX,﻿All right!,
RON,GRIPHOOK,﻿Then you're on our side.,
RON,GRIPHOOK,﻿Who put it there? The fake.,
RON,HARRY,﻿And if we find one? How're we supposed to destroy it if we've given Griphook the sword?,
RON,HARRY,﻿You're sure it's hers?,
RON,HERMIONE,﻿You heard Ollivander. It's Harry's now.,
RON,HARRY,"﻿How will we know what it is when we get in there? After all, a Horcrux can be anything.",
RON,HARRY,﻿That's a bit scary.,
RON,HARRY,"Always good value.	I'll miss her, What d’you think?",
RON,HARRY,Ron studies the mirror as Harry turns it over in his palm. You want to tell me what that is?,
RON,HARRY,You mean he could see you?,
RON,HARRY,Go on.,
RON,﻿BELLATRIX,Bloody hell... that's a sight.,
RON,﻿BELLATRIX,Hideous.,
RON,﻿BELLATRIX,"Couldn't do anything about that bit in the back that's always flipping up, could you?	Dead annoying --",
RON,﻿BELLATRIX,"Never mind.	I'm good, That is you in there, isn't it?",
RON,GRIPHOOK,"Hey.	Easy.",
RON,GRIPHOOK,What do you mean?,
RON,HARRY,"Harry, what do we do?	Harry...?",
RON,GRIPHOOK,"What's that?	Up ahead",
RON,GRIPHOOK,You don't say,
RON,GRIPHOOK,Imperio!,
RON,HERMIONE,"Bloody hell.	That's a Welsh Green.",
RON,HERMIONE,It's been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise,
RON,HERMIONE,Blimey…,
RON,HERMIONE,"Is it here, Harry?Can you feel anything?",
RON,HERMIONE,Keep going!,
RON,HERMIONE,IN HERE,
RON,HERMIONE,"Foul little git.	Least we've got Bogrod., That's unfortunate.",
RON,HERMIONE,"You're asking us?	You're the brilliant one.",
RON,HARRY,That's your idea?,
RON,GRIPHOOK,"That was brilliant!	BRILLIANT!",
RON,HARRY,I say we jump,
RON,HARRY,Never mind! What did you see?,
RON,HARRY,What happens when he finds out four are gone?,
RON,HARRY,What?,
RON,HARRY,Fraid hes right. One problem: Snape's Headmaster now. We cant just walk in the front door.,
RON,HARRY,Maybe its because of the Horcruxes. Maybe he's growing weaker. Maybe he's dying.,
RON,HARRY,What's he mean by that?,
RON,HERMIONE,Did you get a look at him! For a second I thought it was,
RON,HERMIONE,Who's that with her? Bloody hell…,
RON,NEVILLE,I don't remember this being on the Marauder's Map.,
RON,LUNA,"Oh, bloody hell. Here we go.",
RON,CHO,Excuse me. But would someone tell me: what's a bloody diadem?,
RON,HERMIONE,"six months she hasn't seen me and it's like I'm frankie first year. I mean, I'm only her brother.",
RON,SEAMUS,"Shut up, Seamus.",
RON,HERMIONE,"Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking. It doesn't really matter if we find the Horcrux.",
RON,HERMIONE,So we were thinking --,
RON,HERMIONE,"You destroyed Tom Riddle's Diary with a Basilisk fang, right? Well, we know where we might find one, don't we?",
RON,HERMIONE,(in Parseltongue) Take me inside.,
RON,HERMIONE,Harry talks in his sleep. Haven't you noticed?,
RON,HERMIONE,I've never got this far before.,
RON,HERMIONE,Me too.,
RON,HERMIONE,What did you expect it to be like?,
RON,RON,"You do it. Yes, you can.",
RON,HERMIONE,Bloody hell. We'll never find him on this.,
RON,HERMIONE,What? Brilliant.,
RON,HERMIONE,"He must've gone into the Room of Requirement. It doesn't show on the map, remember? You said so last year. That's right. I did. Let's go.",
RON,HERMIONE,RUN! Goyle's set the bloody place on fire!,
RON,HERMIONE,Serves him right.,
RON,HERMIONE,"He's joking, right?",
RON,HARRY,"IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I'LL KILL YOU, HARRY!",
RON,HERMIONE,Brilliant.,
RON,DRACO,You're bloody well welcome! prat.,
RON,HARRY,Where will he take her?,
RON,HERMIONE,"Look inside him, Harry. Find out where he is. If we find him, we find the snake. Then we're one step closer to ending this.",
RON,HARRY,He's gone. The snake too.,
RON,VOLDEMORT,Never! Do you hear me! NEVER!,
RON,HARRY,"We thought you'd gone to the forest, we thought you might be --",
RON,HARRY,Are you mad! No!,
RON,HARRY,Rubbish! You can't just give yourself up to him --,
RON,VOLDEMORT,Liar!,
RON,DRACO,He saved your life.,
RON,DRACO,"Well done, Malfoy! Can't believe I just said that.",
RON,HERMIONE,Hermonie,
RON,HERMIONE,I need to tell you something,
RON,HERMIONE,"Not exactly leaving the place better than we found it, are we?",
RON,HARRY,But that means…,
RON,HARRY,What do you reckon we should do with it?,
RON,HERMIONE,"I'm just saying. That's the Elder Wand! It's the most powerful bloody wand in the world! With that, we could, we could --",
SEAMUS,NEVILLE,"Not more of Aberforth's cooking, I hope. Be a surprise if we could digest it.",
SEAMUS,HARRY,That's nothing to go on.,
SEAMUS,RON,"Got loads of those, though, doesn't she? There's only one Harry.",
SEAMUS,NEVILLE,I can bring'er down.,
SEAMUS,NEVILLE,That's it. I want a charge on each and every joist.,
SEAMUS,NEVILLE,Woah! Easy up there!,
SEAMUS,SEAMUS,He's good...He's good…,
SEAMUS,NEVILLE,Told yeh I'd bring'er down. ,
SEAMUS,GINNY,That was kind of exciting.,
SEAMUS,NEVILLE,"Stand down, Neville!",
SIRIUS BLACK,JAMES POTTER,Quicker than falling asleep.,
SIRIUS BLACK,JAMES POTTER,"No. We're here, you see.",
SNAPE,STUDENTS,Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you here at this hour. It has come to my attention that earlier this evening... Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.,
SNAPE,STUDENTS,I mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by rumor.,
SNAPE,STUDENTS,"For myself and a few select members of the staff this comes as little surprise. We have, for some time, considered Mr. Potter's return to Hogwarts to be not only possible but inevitable. Consequently, in the past several months and under my specific direction, exhaustive defensive strategies have been employed to defeat any attempt Mr. Potter might make to breach these walls. But know this. Should anyone -- student or staff -- attempt to aid Mr. Potter, that person will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. Rest assured: So long as I am Headmaster at Hogwarts, Harry Potter will never again step foot in this castle.",
SNAPE,STUDENTS,Now then. If anyone here has knowledge of Mr. Potter's movements this evening... I invite them to step forward now.,
SNAPE,VOLDEMORT,"You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord. In the last few hours alone --",
SNAPE,VOLDEMORT,"There is no wand more powerful. Ollivander himself said it. Tonight, when the boy comes to you, it will not fail you, I am sure. It answers to you and you only.",
SNAPE,VOLDEMORT,My Lord?,
SNAPE,VOLDEMORT,"With you, of course, my Lord.",
SNAPE,VOLDEMORT,My Lord --,
SNAPE,HARRY,Take them… Take them! Please.,
SNAPE,HARRY,They are the same… You have your mother's eyes…,
SNAPE,SNAPE,Lily...,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,No! Don't kill me!,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,None. I come on my own account. I come with a... request.,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Yes.,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Only what I heard. But now... he thinks it refers to her.,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Yes! But he thinks it's her son! He intends to hunt them down now! To kill them!,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,I have asked.,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,She's more than that! She's different! Beautiful. Kind. Hide them all. I beg you.,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Anything.,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,You said you would keep her safe!,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,DON't!,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,He doesn't need protection. The Dark Lord has gone --,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,No one can know. Your word.,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,He exhibits no measurable talent. His arrogance rivals even his father's. And he seems to relish his fame.,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,You see what you want to see.,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Why did you put it on? Surely you realized it carried a curse.,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Drink the rest. It will contain the curse to the hand for the time being.,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Maybe a year.,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,It is not expected that he will succeed.,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,You ask too much.,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Tell him what?,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,"So when the time comes, the boy must die.",
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,You've kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment. You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Expecto Patronum!,
SNAPE,DUMBLEDORE,Always...,
SORTING HAT,NEVILLE,"Don't despair, Longbottom. I put you in Gryffindor for good reason...",
TEACHERS,STUDENTS,Protego Maxima... Finato Duri... Repello Inimicum...,
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,I do not answer to that name.,
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,Are you a friend of Luna's?,
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,You seek my mother's diadem.,
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,"Luna is kind. Unlike so many of the others, but she was wrong. I cannot help you.",
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,Many have sought my mother's diadem. Its powers are legendary…,
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,"She thought I took it to hurt her. But I only wanted to be more like her, clever and wise. She wore it so beautifully, but on me... I grew to hate it... the pain I felt... the pain I feel even now…",
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,"Another swore to destroy it, many years ago, a strange boy with a strange name…",
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,But he lied.,
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,I know what he's done! I know who he is! He defiled it! With Dark Magic!,
THE GREY LADY,HARRY,"Strange... you remind me of him a bit…It's here. In the castle. In the place where everything is hidden...If you have to ask, you'll never know. If you know, you need only ask...",
TRELAWNEY,SEAMUS,"There's more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan.",

WEASLEY,﻿BELLATRIX,"Not my daughter , You bitch .",
WEASLEY,GEORGE,"Back off, boys . She's mine .",
WEASLEY,﻿BELLATRIX,You will never touch my children again.,
YOUNG SNAPE,LILY,She's jealous. Because she's ordinary and you're special.,
YOUNG SNAPE,LILY,It's true. You know so yourself.,
